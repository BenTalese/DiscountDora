"""Per-ingredient at-risk flags on the recipe DTO (owner feedback 2026-08-17).

The cookbook can filter to "uses expiring ingredients", but opening a result
didn't say *which* ingredient qualified — you were left comparing the list
against the pantry by hand. `RecipeIngredientDto.is_expiring` / `is_expired`
carry that answer.

The contract worth pinning is the agreement: an ingredient is flagged under
exactly the horizon the filter matched on (`EXPIRING_HORIZON_DAYS`), so a
recipe the filter returned can never open with nothing marked. The 8-to-13-day
band is the interesting one — it's inside the filter's 14 days but outside the
client's 7-day expiry *display* band, which is precisely where a client-side
re-derivation would silently disagree.
