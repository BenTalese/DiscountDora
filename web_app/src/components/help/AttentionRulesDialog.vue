                A stock row speaks four things, and only four: the
                <strong>level box</strong> (its colour, and whether its edge is
                dashed), the <strong>row treatment</strong> (outlined, plain or
                dimmed — one scale, not three signals), the
                <strong>essential edge stripe</strong>, and the
                <strong>expiry button</strong> (with the open/sealed toggle
                beside it). The same rules also drive the
                "<em>Needs attention</em>" count in the footer and its
                matching filter chip, so what you see highlighted is
                exactly what the count is counting.

            <!-- ── At-a-glance legend ─────────────────────────────────
                 2026-08-15 feedback: this used to live in the stock
                 overview's filter panel, which is not where a reference
                 belongs — but its visual examples were the good part, so
                 the component moves here intact rather than being
                 reworded into prose.
                 It also replaces the hand-written level table that sat
                 here: that table hardcoded three level names and their
                 colours, so a household that renamed a level (or added a
                 fourth) was read the wrong thing. StockRowLegend derives
                 both from the live level rows via the same
                 `colourForSequence` authority the row itself uses (R-003),
                 so this page cannot drift from what it documents. -->

                 outline and a red "alert" one; a hedged alarm gets ignored,
                 and amber sat directly around the amber Low level square.
                 The copy follows the code (D-7) rather than the code being
                 left to disagree with the help page. -->

                An outlined row needs you. There's one outline, and it means
                one thing — three conditions turn it on:

                            The item has <strong>expired</strong>, it's
                            <strong>expiring soon</strong> (your setting decides
                            how soon), or it's flagged <strong>essential</strong>
                            and has run low or out.

                can't tell you different things. Turning a kind off under

                essential is set-and-forget, on the item's own page.)
                Essentials are the ONLY items whose stock level
                drives an outline — a non-essential item running Low or Out
                is silent, because the level square already says so and Dora
                shouldn't be loud about things you didn't say mattered.

                them when scanning for what to do next. Out essentials
                stay full opacity so the loudest "go restock" signal
                isn't quieted by the fade.

                 the buy verdict. The verdict came off the row entirely

                 (D-5) — because to a reader they said the same thing, and a
