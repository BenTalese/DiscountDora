"""USDA FoodData Central bulk-dataset import.

The "download button" nutrition source: fetch a CSV bundle from USDA, parse it,
and populate `NutritionFood` + `NutritionPortion`. Deliberately the *default*
provider, because it's the only one with no strings attached — FDC data is
public domain (CC0), so it can be redistributed, cached and used offline
without attribution or share-alike obligations, unlike Open Food Facts (ODbL).

Only the two generic-food datasets are offered:

  Foundation  ~3.7MB zipped / 32MB unzipped — current, well-curated
  SR Legacy   ~6.7MB zipped / 54MB unzipped — frozen 2018, far broader

Branded Foods is deliberately *not* offered: at 428MB zipped / 2.9GB unzipped
it dwarfs everything else in the app, and packaged goods are better reached by
barcode through Open Food Facts anyway. Generic foods are what recipe
ingredients actually name ("flour", "banana"), which is what the rollup needs.

Runs on a daemon thread with in-memory status, the same shape as the Piper
voice download (`features/tts/voice_provision.py`) — the user starts it, the
admin page polls. Status is a transient UI hint; the durable truth is simply
how many rows the dataset has, which `sources.py` reads back.
