    <!-- dashboard's kitchen-health card. Reads the composite +
         five-component breakdown from `useDoraScore()`; renders each
         component in its own box.

         The `InfoTip` beside the title went on 2026-09-08 (*"I don't think we
         need the info chip for this widget?"*) — and he is right for a reason
         worth writing down: every sentence that tip carried is now *shown*.
         The ring names its window, each signal box states its own reason in
         plain words, and a dormant box says "not counted" on its face. A tip
         explaining a card that explains itself is a card that doesn't. -->

            <!-- Owner 2026-09-08 — *"Can make the top area of the card look
                 more pretty/interesting/satisfying. Maybe a hollow circle
                 design or something else?"* A hollow ring it is, and it earns
                 its place beyond decoration: the old head was a bare numeral
                 beside the words "out of 100", which asked the reader to hold
                 a scale in their head. A ring *is* the scale — 72 out of 100
                 is 72% of the way round, readable before you read the digits.

                 Same SVG idiom as `PantryDonutCard`'s donut, deliberately: one
                 `stroke-dasharray` arc on a 15.915r circle (circumference ≈
                 100, so the array value is literally the percentage), rotated
                 -90deg so it starts at twelve o'clock. Unlike that donut this
                 one takes no runtime palette read — the arc is a single
                 traffic-light class, so plain CSS `stroke` works and there is
                 no `paletteToken` dependency to keep honest (FU-824). -->

     * renders what it hands back.
     *
     * Owner review 2026-09-04 swapped two components (see
     * `DoraScoreComponentKey` server-side for the reasoning). The 2026-09-08
     * batch then reworked the card's *presentation* on five items — a hollow
     * ring instead of a bare numeral, one box per signal, no InfoTip, no
     * per-row action links, and dormant signals rendering identically whatever
     * made them dormant. Each is annotated at its site in the template above.
     *
     * One consequence worth stating plainly: **this card no longer links
     * anywhere.** That includes the `plan_adherence` row, which since 09-04 was
     * the replacement for the deleted "Reconcile past meals" card — the owner's
     * *"put that metric as the link to go do meal reconciliation"*. The metric
     * stays and the link goes, because the same batch's standing decision
     * ("Remove them all I reckon") applies to it too; `/meal-plans/reconcile` is
     * reachable from the meal-plans header nudge, which was never removed.
