"""20260826_store_brand_colour

Shopping-list feedback 2026-08-26 — the "Where you'll spend it" store
breakdown coloured its buckets from a categorical chart ramp, so Woolworths
could come out red and Coles green. The colour is now derived from the store's
own uploaded logo (majority/primary colour), which is a fact about the store,
not about the chart — hence a column rather than a client-side computation.

Backfilled here because logos already uploaded would otherwise stay on the
hash swatch forever: there is no other write path that would revisit them.
The extraction is best-effort — a greyscale or unreadable logo simply leaves
NULL, which is the fallback the SPA already handles.
