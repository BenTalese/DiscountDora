"""FU-536 — Alembic migration round-trip + integrity tests.

116 migration files run at startup via `flask_migrate.upgrade()` and had ZERO
tests. A bad downgrade, a non-portable op, or a data-losing migration would
only surface in production — and the Postgres migration (FU-045) makes
portability imminent. This is the largest untested surface by file count.

Two layers:

  * IN-PROCESS, no DB (fast, zero risk) — read the Alembic ScriptDirectory:
    exactly one head (unambiguous startup upgrade), linear history with no
    orphaned down_revision, and every revision defines a real downgrade (not
    a silent `pass`, bar an explicit allowlist).

  * SUBPROCESS against a throwaway SQLite file (slower, fully isolated) —
    the app's migration run is coupled to `current_app`'s engine, and the
    app singleton in THIS process is bound to the e2e test DB; running
    `downgrade base` in-process would clobber it mid-suite. So each real
    up/down run happens in a child `python -c` with `DORA_DB_PATH` pointed at
    a temp file — a fresh app on a fresh DB, zero blast radius here.
