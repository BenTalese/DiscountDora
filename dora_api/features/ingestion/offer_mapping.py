"""Shared offer-append mapping (R-003).

`POST /api/ingest` and `POST /api/products` both end up in the same
question: "given a product and a new price, what changes in the
catalogue?" This module owns that one answer, so the two callers don't
drift.

The mapping rule (PROPOSAL_INGESTION_API §2.3, "append-only; never
overwrite"):

- An unchanged offer (same `price_now` at the same `observed_at`) is a
  no-op. Dedupe key: `(product_id, observed_at, price_now)`.
- A new price → append a `ProductHistoricOffer` *and* move
  `current_offer` to the new value (so the catalogue read still reads
  the latest).
- The historic point carries the `source` string for provenance.

The mapping returns a small status so the caller can build per-record
result lines (`accepted` / `skipped`) without inspecting model state.
