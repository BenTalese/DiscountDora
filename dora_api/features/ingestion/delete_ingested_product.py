"""`DELETE /api/ingest/products/<id>` — the companion's "unsave".

PF-4 says unsaving deletes through the same path Dora's own UI uses, and it
does: this route is a thin bearer-authenticated front door onto
`products.delete_product.DeleteProductHandler`. There is exactly one delete
*behaviour* — cascade rules, shopping-line retention, all of it — and two ways
in, because the two callers authenticate differently:

* Dora's SPA holds a `dora_session` cookie → `DELETE /api/products/<id>`
* an ingestion source holds a bearer key → this route

An ingestion source is an ordinary external client (PF-9), so it gets no
privilege the SPA lacks; it just can't present a session cookie. The same split
already exists on the read side — `/api/ingest/link-status` is the bearer-authed
door onto product lookups.

The caller supplies Dora's own `product_id`, which is what
`/api/ingest/link-status` hands back for a product Dora already holds — so the
companion decorates its search results, then unsaves by the id it was given. No
new identity scheme.
