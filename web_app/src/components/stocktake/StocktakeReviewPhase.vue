    <!--
        Phase 1 of the three-phase stocktake — **Review** (D-3 / D-4).
        A desk screen: these items are worked out from logged evidence
        (purchases, cooks), so you don't need to be standing in the pantry to
        agree with them.

        **The critical constraint from D-3: this must NOT be a "Confirm all (12)"
        button.** Users tap that reflexively by session three, at which point it
        *is* the auto-check that was explicitly rejected, with a human-shaped fig
        leaf — and every risk that rejection was protecting against comes back.

        So the screen is built to be *read*: real item names and the two levels
        — believed and recorded — one row each. Owner, 2026-09-12: the reason
        line was dropped. On this screen you are agreeing or disagreeing at a
        glance, twelve times in a row; the cadence story behind each guess is a
        paragraph nobody reads here. It still lives on the walk card and the
        stock-item page, where you're looking at one item. Everything is
        pre-ticked, so agreeing is still one tap. The value being delivered is
        not "confirm in bulk" — it's that **disagreeing is cheap**: untick a row
        and it joins the items you check yourself.

        Copy note (owner, 2026-09-01): nothing user-facing says "walk". The
        internal phase is still called that — it names the posture, and the
        server sends a `walk` array — but on screen this is all just stocktake.
