    /**
     * One line on the shopping list's run face — the list as it is used in a
     * store.
     *
     * Built on the shared row skeleton in `src/css/shoppingList.scss`, same as
     * the plan and receipt rows (v4 chunk 5, FU-807). Until then this face was
     * the one surface still rendering `q-list bordered separator` + `q-item`
     * while the other two had moved to slabs — a hard border, `--radius-md` and
     * edge-to-edge separators against their soft slab and inset dividers.
     *
     * `q-item` is gone for the same reason chunk 1 dropped it from the plan
     * row: it ships its own padding, min-heights and `--side` alignment, which
     * is what the row then has to fight. The row is a `role="button"` div
     * rather than a `<button>` because it contains the price button, and a
     * button inside a button is invalid — so Enter and Space are wired
     * explicitly, which is what `q-item clickable` was providing.
     *
     * What makes it the *run* face is unchanged and deliberate: one row, one
     * gesture, an optional price, and a thumb-sized target. Everything that
     * exists to curate a list stays on the plan face.
