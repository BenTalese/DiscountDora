"""GET /api/dashboard/restock-radar — what recently went low or out.

Owner feedback, 2026-09-04: *"Restock radar looks like it could be useful. I
don't know how it works under the hood, but I think showing a list of most
recently out of stock and a list of most recently low (one on left, one on
right) could be good."*

What it used to show was `/reports/keeps-running-out` — a genuinely clever
signal (how often an item was *already out* at the moment somebody added it to
a list, i.e. "you ran out before you got round to restocking it"), and the
reports review rated it the most insightful thing on either surface. But it is
a **history** signal: it ranks by a lifetime count, so the card looked
identical week after week and the "radar" never swept. It also needs months of
list history before it says anything, which is why a young install saw only the
empty state.

This is the present tense of the same idea: the things that changed band most
recently, which is what a radar is for. `keeps-running-out` is untouched and
still on the reports page, where a lifetime ranking belongs.

`stock_level_last_updated` is the clock, not a `ConsumptionEvent` scan: the
question is "when did this item become out", and that column *is* when its band
last changed. An event scan would additionally need deduping per item and
reconciling against the current level, to arrive at the same answer more
expensively.

Only items **currently** in the band are listed. "Recently went out" about
something you have since restocked is not a restock cue, it is a diary entry.

## Owner batch, 2026-09-08 — this card absorbed "Before you shop"

Two of that batch's items were about the same thing. He first asked *Before you
shop* to grow a level indicator, a "recently low or out" heading and
recency-with-a-cutoff ordering — and then, further down the same list,
concluded: *"There's a lot of crossover between before you shop and restock
radar. I'm inclined to axe before you shop and chuck 'planned' as a chip on the
rows for restock radar."* Later points win, so `get_before_you_shop.py` is
deleted and its two surviving ideas landed here:

  **one list, not two.** Out and Low were two columns ordered by recency
  *within* a column, so the single most recent change wasn't necessarily at the
  top of the card. One list ordered purely by recency answers "what changed
  lately" — and the band, which the columns were carrying, is now carried by
  the level dot at the head of each row (`StockLevelDot`, the same indicator the
  stock pages use) rather than by which column you're reading.

  **`is_planned`**, the one thing *Before you shop* knew that nothing else did:
  the upcoming plan wants this item. That came from `gather_planned_demand` and
  it still does — the same signal the stock-item page's planned-demand card and
  the planner read (R-003), not a second derivation of it.

`MAX_AGE_DAYS` is the other half of the same feedback: *"Don't show stuff that
has been low/out for a long time."* An item that went out in March is not a
restock cue either — it is something the household has decided to live without,
and it sat at the bottom of this card forever crowding out the things that
actually changed this week. Thirty days is one shopping month: long enough that
a fortnightly shopper still sees last cycle's misses, short enough that the
list turns over. The item stays *visible* — on the stock page, filtered by
level, which is the surface that owns "everything you're out of". This card
only claims to be the recent ones, and its empty copy now says so rather than
claiming everything is stocked.

The list-membership filter *Before you shop* also applied ("only show what
isn't already on a list") deliberately did **not** come across — see
`DORA_FOLLOWUPS.md` FU-897. Each row carries `AddToListButton`, which already
shows its own on-a-list state, so the fact is on screen; using it to *hide*
rows is a separate call the owner hasn't made.
