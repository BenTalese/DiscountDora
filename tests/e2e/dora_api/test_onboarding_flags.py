"""FU-193 — backend behavioural coverage for the Onboarding C-5.3/.4/.5 surfaces.

Covers products data-presence gating (FU-209), the install-wide household
cooking config (FU-615 — headcount + batch cook-style, moved off User onto
AppSetting), and the starter catalogue + name-resolved item seeding.
Migrations themselves are verified separately (single head + well-formed batch
DDL); these tests assert the runtime round-trips that the wizard relies on.
