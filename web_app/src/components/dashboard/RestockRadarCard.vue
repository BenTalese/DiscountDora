     * Restock radar — what recently went low or out, most recent first.
     *
     * Reworked on the owner's ask, 2026-09-04. It used to render
     * `/reports/keeps-running-out`: how often an item was already out at the
     * moment somebody put it on a list. A sharp signal, and the reports review
     * rated it the best thing on either surface — but it ranks on a *lifetime*
     * count, so the card looked the same every week and the radar never swept.
     * It also says nothing at all until an install has months of list history.
     *
     * This is the present tense of the same idea, and it keeps the verb: every
     * row ends in the stock overview's own cart button. The lifetime ranking
     * still lives on the reports page, which is where a history belongs.
     *
     * **2026-09-08 — this card absorbed "Before you shop".** The owner's list
     * asked that card for a level indicator, a "recently low or out" heading
     * and recency ordering, and then concluded a few items later that the two
     * cards overlapped and *"I'm inclined to axe before you shop and chuck
     * 'planned' as a chip on the rows for restock radar"*. Later points win, so
     * all of it landed here:
     *
     *   · **one list, not two columns.** Out and Low were ordered by recency
     *     *within* a column, so the most recent change was not necessarily the
     *     top row — which is the only claim a radar makes. The band is the
     *     level dot at the head of the row now.
     *   · **`is_planned`** — a chip, straight off `gather_planned_demand`.
     *   · **a staleness cutoff**, server-side: *"don't show stuff that has been
     *     low/out for a long time"*.
     *
     * Everything above is server-decided (`/dashboard/restock-radar`); this file
     * picks words and shapes (R-003).
