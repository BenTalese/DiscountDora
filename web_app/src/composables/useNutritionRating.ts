// The recipe front-of-pack rating — whether this install shows one, which one,
// and how to read a recipe's (owner ask 2026-08-27).
//
// Was `useHealthStarRating`. It became scheme-aware the same week, because a
// single-scheme composable forced every caller to say "health stars" in its
// UI copy, which is how the whole feature ended up looking like it was for
// Australia only.
//
// Two conditions, and both are the server's answer rather than ours:
//
//   * `nutrition_rating_scheme` — the install-wide choice: 'none' (the default
//     everywhere), 'health_star' (AU/NZ) or 'nutri_score' (Europe). Settings →
//     Region's "Match this device" offers the locally recognised one; the
//     picker in Settings → Nutrition takes any of them anywhere.
//   * complex nutrition mode — a rating is computed from the foods the
//     ingredients link to, so simple mode (a typed kcal and nothing else) has
//     nothing to score. A scheme selected in simple mode is a no-op, not an
//     error.
//
// Nothing here re-derives a rating. Both sets of published tables live
// server-side (`dora_api/domain/health_star_rating.py`, `.../nutri_score.py`)
// and transcribing either a second time in TypeScript is exactly the drift
// R-003 exists to prevent. What this file *does* own is presentation: how to
// rank two recipes against each other and what the threshold control offers,
// which are view concerns and belong here rather than in the API.
