    /**
     * "My budget" — spend against the household's budget period, and nothing
     * else.
     *
     * This was `MoneyCard` / "Grocery spend", and the 2026-09-08 owner batch cut
     * it down to what its title claims:
     *
     *   · **"Kept vs RRP" is gone** — *"remove the bottom part 'kept vs RRP',
     *     product data is a niche area of the app"*. That half carried its own
     *     range toggle, its own window (which R-071 then required be labelled,
     *     because it never matched the budget period above it), an `InfoTip`
     *     explaining what RRP meant, and an `AnimatedNumber`. All of it to state
     *     a figure that only exists on installs whose lines carry captured deal
     *     prices — i.e. the products path. It is still on `/reports`, which is
     *     the surface for a retrospective money question.
     *   · **the swaps bullet is gone** — *"what's with the 'save $$$ this week #
     *     swaps ready'? Substitutes are for cooking when you must use one, not
     *     to get a cheaper shop."* He is right about the semantics, and the
     *     bullet was also a third window on one card (the current *plan* week,
     *     which is neither of the other two). FU-451's swap panel keeps its
     *     home in the planner, where the swap is actually made.
     *   · **the active-lists line was reworded** — see the template.
     *
     * What that leaves is one window, one question, one number, which is what
     * ADR-068's "spend is the headline" was reaching for; the supporting line it
     * kept was simply the wrong support.
     *
     * ⚠️ **`savings` / `SavingsCapturedResponse` no longer has a dashboard
     * caller.** It is NOT orphaned — `/reports` still calls it — but per R-057 a
     * replaced surface's contracts are an inventory to check: see FU-898.
     *
     * Extracted from `DashboardPage.vue` (FU-829). The page keeps the fetch.
