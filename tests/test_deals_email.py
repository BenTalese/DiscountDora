"""Weekly deals digest — policy + wording unit tests (FU-789, built 2026-08-29).

Every test drives the module-level pure functions with plain fixtures — no DB,
no clock, no SMTP — mirroring `test_daily_brief.py`. The job around them is a
repo walk; its gate chain is documented in `send_deals_email.py` and exercised
by the e2e suite.

What's pinned:
  • the weekday convention, because getting it wrong mails on the wrong day
    rather than failing
  • the ledger key is ISO-week-scoped, so moving your send day mid-week can't
    produce a second copy, and a year boundary doesn't collide
  • a product that isn't genuinely cheaper than its RRP never reaches the
    template, even if the ranked pool hands one over
  • money formatting falls back to the ISO code rather than guessing a symbol
  • the subject leads with the discount only when the discount is worth leading
    with
