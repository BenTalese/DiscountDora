"""The **dense** dev dataset — small enough to read end to end, deep enough to
walk every path (owner request, 2026-08-31).

Two dev datasets now exist and they answer different questions:

* `seed.py::seed_dev_data()` — the **load** dataset. Its curated core plus
  `DORA_SEED_BULK_ITEMS` (default 500) generated items exists so N+1s and slow
  queries surface at volume. Kept as-is; select it with `DORA_SEED_DATASET=bulk`.
* **this module** — the **depth** dataset. No generated filler at all. Every
  row is hand-placed to put some surface into a state a walker needs to see,
  and the household reads like a real one rather than "Load item 0413".

The rule that decides what belongs here: *does the app render something
different because of this row?* A second nearly-identical stocked pantry item
renders the same card as the first, so it isn't here. A stock item with **no**
group, location, expiry, product, note or history is a completely different
render (every optional block collapses) — so that item is here, deliberately,
as `bicarb`. The same reasoning gives us a recipe with ten steps, sub-steps,
two sections and per-step tool links sitting next to a recipe that is a name
and nothing else.

**What "exercise every path" means concretely.** Each block below states which
surface it feeds. The intent is that a walker can open any screen in the app
and find it non-empty *and* find its edge cases without hand-editing the DB:

    stock overview    every level x expiry x open x essential x alerts combo
    stock detail      one item with every optional block filled, one with none,
                      one whose History tab overflows the per-kind cap
    cookbook          cookable / not / at-risk / unknown, all three step modes,
                      photo and no-photo cards, a version pair, an empty
                      collection, optional + sectioned + unlinked ingredients
    cook mode         freeform, structured (10 steps, 3 with sub-steps, hints,
                      per-step ingredients + tools) and image (5 real photos)
    meal planner      a past week fully consumed, this week part-cooked with a
                      cook batch and a shortfall, a future week forked from a
                      template, plus a rotating template set
    shopping lists    draft / mid-shop / two finished, every `added_via`, a
                      planned-vs-purchased store split, a budget-deferred line,
                      a receipt attachment, and price observations harvested
                      from the finished lists exactly as /finish does
    stocktake         all three confidence ranks, so Review / Walk / Tidy-up
                      each have members, plus a Sweep drop-out
    products          offer history for sparklines, an unavailable product, a
                      multipack, barcodes (product-tied, item-direct, both),
                      a price alert
    alerts + Dora     a disabled kind, read / snoozed / dismissed interactions,
                      a dismissed and a snoozed suggestion
    settings          nutrition foods with portions + a linked and an ignored
                      item, a second household member, a deactivated account

Determinism: no RNG anywhere, same as the load seed. Everything is relative to
one `now` / `today` pair so a re-seed on a different day lands the same shapes.

    # ══ INFERENCE / STOCKTAKE FIXTURES ═══════════════════════════════════
    # Dora's belief only says anything when it DISAGREES with the recorded
    # level, and it can only disagree when it has a purchase cadence to reason
    # from. Everything above has thin history on purpose (so the hint stays
    # quiet on most of the pantry); these seven carry engineered histories that
    # land in each visible state.
    #
    # Numbers are against `features/stock_items/pantry_belief.py`:
    #   cadence  = mean gap between purchase dates (needs >= 2)
    #   progress = days_since_last_purchase / cadence + 0.34 per cook since
    #   band     = stocked < 0.75 <= low < 1.15 <= out
    #   conf     = clamp((n-1)/3, .25, 1) * clamp(1.1 - .5*progress, .2, 1)
    #              with high >= 0.66, medium >= 0.33
    # Each fixture's arithmetic is spelled out beside it, because the numbers
    # are meaningless without it and the next person to move a date needs to
    # know which band they just left.
    #
    # All but the orange juice have `stocktake_alerts=True` and are >= 25 days
    # stale, so they are genuinely overdue and land in the queue at three
    # different confidence ranks — the only way the runner's three phases
    # (Review = the confident ones, Walk, Tidy-up) all have members in one
    # session. None is inside the model's 3-day fresh-hard-signal window,
    # which would otherwise make the belief defer to the recorded level.
    #
    # **Review carries four items, not one** (owner, 2026-09-03: the seed
    # "needs something to make the initial 'Dora's pretty sure about these'
    # screen"). One row is not a screen — it reads as a stray item rather than
    # a desk pass — and the phase's whole argument is that you can *scan a
    # column* of beliefs and untick the odd one. Four is enough for that, and
    # each says something different: Weet-Bix (~Low from the calendar), Peanut
    # Butter (~Low because a cook pushed it over), Rolled Oats (Stocked and
    # agreeing — most of a real pass is agreement), Tinned Tomatoes (Stocked
    # against a recorded Low: you restocked and never said so).
    #
    # Note the ceiling this phase has by construction: HIGH confidence needs
    # `1.1 - 0.5*progress >= 0.66`, i.e. progress <= 0.88, so a *confident*
    # belief can only ever be Stocked or Low. "Confidently Out" is unreachable
    # — being deep past a cycle is exactly when an unlogged restock is likely.
    # Don't try to seed one.
    #
    # **The purchase history is a shared shop schedule, not one list per item.**
    # The load seed gives each fixture its own single-line "Weet-Bix shop 3"
    # list, which works but leaves twenty junk lists in the archive and makes
    # the spend surfaces read as nonsense. Here, eight finished shops on a
    # fortnightly-with-top-ups rhythm carry all of it, and each one looks like
    # a shop someone actually did. Same signal, a tenth of the clutter, and the
    # reports/budget surfaces get a believable three months of history for free.
