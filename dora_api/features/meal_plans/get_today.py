"""GET /api/meal-plans/today — the household's current date in the install's
configured timezone (Meal Plans C-2.K).

The planner trusts this rather than recomputing "today" from the browser clock,
so past-day dimming + the drop guard match the server's date-boundary rules
exactly (no UTC-vs-local drift).
