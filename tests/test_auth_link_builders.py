"""Regression pins for the e-mailed SPA deep-link format.

The SPA runs in **hash-history** mode (`web_app/quasar.config` →
build.vueRouterMode: 'hash'), so every link e-mailed to a user that targets an
in-app route MUST carry the route in the URL *fragment* (`…/#/reset-password?
token=…`). A path-based link (`…/reset-password?token=…`) is served the SPA
shell but the hash router never sees the route — it resolves to `/`, and the
auth guard bounces the logged-out visitor to `#/login`. That silently
dead-ended every password-reset / verify-email link.

These pure unit tests (no server, no request context — the builders fall back
to the localhost dev origin) fix that contract in place so it can't regress.
