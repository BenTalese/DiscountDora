"""The Health Star Rating algorithm, as published by FSANZ.

Transcribed from **Health Star Rating system Calculator and Style Guide,
June 2025, Version 8.1** (healthstarrating.gov.au) — Tables 1, 4, 6 and 7 and
the Step 4–7 method. Nothing here is Dora's invention: the thresholds, the
point ceilings, the protein gate and the score→star bands are the published
ones, and the docstrings name the table each came from so a reader can check
them against the source without trusting this file.

Pure and repository-free, like `domain/stock_status.py`: callers pass an
already-computed per-100g nutrient profile and get a rating back. That keeps
the one piece of the feature anybody would want to audit — the arithmetic —
free of I/O and trivially testable against the worked examples in the guide.

**Scope: Category 2 only.** The guide defines six categories (1 non-dairy
beverages, 1D milk and dairy beverages, 2 all other foods, 2D dairy foods,
3 oils and spreads, 3D cheese). A *recipe* is a dish, and Category 2 is
literally "all foods other than those included in Category 1, 1D, 2D, 3 or
3D" — so it is both the correct answer and the default. The other five
categories are defined by properties of a packaged product (calcium per
100 mL, ≥75% dairy content, being an edible oil as defined in Standard 2.4.1)
that a home recipe has no way to assert, and guessing at them would move a
dish between star bands on the strength of a guess. If a category ever needs
to be chosen, it should be chosen by a human, not inferred here.

**Two honest departures from the published method**, both forced by the
difference between a packaged product and a recipe, and both surfaced to the
user rather than hidden:

1. *Per 100 g of what.* HSR scores the product as consumed. Dora can only sum
   raw ingredient weights, so the denominator is the raw weight of everything
   it could resolve. A sauce that reduces reads too kindly; a soup made with
   water nobody listed as an ingredient reads too harshly. Owner's call
   2026-08-27: accept it and label the rating an estimate rather than add a
   finished-weight field nobody would fill in.
2. *The automatic ratings* in Step 1 (plain water → 5, unsweetened flavoured
   water → 4.5, fresh and minimally processed fruit and vegetables → 5) are
   **not** implemented. They are rules about how a *product* is sold and
   processed, not about a dish, and a recipe made of fresh produce scores
   close to 5 on the calculator anyway.

# Dora stores energy as kcal (`NutritionFood.kcal_per_100g`) because that is

# separate kJ row, and importing it would avoid this conversion — but it is
# derived from the same Atwater factors, the two agree to well under a percent,
# and Table 1's energy bands are **335 kJ wide**. A sub-1% difference can only
# change the answer for a food sitting exactly on a band edge, which is not
# worth a second energy column and a second thing to keep in step (R-002).
