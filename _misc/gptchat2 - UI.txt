After a user logs in to your web application, the landing page should typically be a dashboard that provides an overview of the main features and functionalities of your application. A well-designed dashboard can help users quickly access the most important information and actions within your application. Here are some common design choices and components for a user dashboard:

1. User Profile Information: Display the user's profile picture, name, and any other relevant user information. Allow users to update their profile settings if necessary.

2. Navigation Menu: Include a navigation menu or sidebar that provides links or icons for accessing different sections of your application. Each link should represent a major feature or module, such as "Stock Items," "Shopping Lists," "Search Products," "Weekly Deals," and so on.

3. Summary Cards: Use summary cards or panels to highlight key information related to the user's activity on the platform. For example:

    Stock Items Summary: Show the total number of stock items the user has added.
    Shopping Lists Summary: Display the number of active shopping lists and items in those lists.
    Notifications: Indicate if there are any unread notifications or updates.

4. Recent Activity: Provide a feed or list of recent user activity. This could include recent changes to stock items, shopping list updates, or notifications.

5. Quick Actions: Include buttons or shortcuts for common actions. For example:

    Add New Stock Item: Allow users to quickly add a new stock item.
    Create Shopping List: Provide a button to create a new shopping list.
    Search Products: Offer a prominent search bar or button to initiate product searches.

6. Weekly Deals: If weekly deals are a significant feature, consider dedicating a section of the dashboard to showcase current or upcoming deals from various merchants.

7. Notifications: Include a notification panel or icon that alerts users to important events, such as items coming back in stock, updates to shopping lists, or new messages.

8. Meal Tracking: If meal tracking is a central feature, display meal planning information, such as the meals currently in stock and planned meals for the week.

9. Recipe Catalogue: If you have a recipe catalog, provide a section or link to browse and discover new recipes.

10. User-Specific Content: Tailor the content of the dashboard to each user's preferences and previous interactions. For example, if a user frequently searches for specific products, consider showing personalized product recommendations.

11. Search Bar: Place a search bar at the top of the dashboard to allow users to quickly find specific items or products.

12. Logout Option: Include a logout option in the navigation menu or header to allow users to log out when they are done using the application.

13. Responsive Design: Ensure that the dashboard is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, including mobile devices, to provide a seamless user experience.

14. User Preferences: Allow users to customize their dashboard layout or choose which widgets and information panels they want to see.
