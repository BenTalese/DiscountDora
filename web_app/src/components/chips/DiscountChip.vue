    /** The one "% off" badge (FU-885 / feedback PH-6).
     *
     *  Was implemented four times — `MyProductsPage`, `StockItemDetailPage`,
     *  the (dead) `ProductChip`, and Price History, which also rendered it a
     *  different colour and a smaller size. The owner asked why it "feels
     *  different elsewhere"; it was, in three ways at once.
     *
     *  **Green, not red.** The two old spellings disagreed (`negative` on the
     *  product surfaces, `positive` on Price History) and the app's own
     *  semantics break the tie: D-001 reserves escalation red for urgency —
     *  out of stock, destructive, error. A discount is good news, so painting
     *  it red both misreads and competes with the states that genuinely need
     *  the alarm colour. The My Products card was the clearest symptom: the
     *  discount was red while its *out of stock* badge was amber, exactly
     *  inverting D-001's escalation.
     *
     *  Percentage rounding lives here rather than at the call sites (D-006:
     *  one formatting authority).
