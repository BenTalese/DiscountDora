/**
 * Speech output for Dora — used by Cook mode (announces the current step) and
 * Dora chat (speaks her replies when the user has output enabled).
 *
 * Two engines, chosen per-user (`voice_engine`):
 *   - `piper`   — POST /api/tts for a natural neural voice, played back through
 *                 an <audio> element. The user's `voice_id` picks the voice.
 *   - `browser` — the built-in Web SpeechSynthesis API (the original path).
 *
 * Piper is preferred when selected, but if it isn't configured/installed
 * server-side (the endpoint 503s) or the request otherwise fails, we fall back
 * to the browser voice for that utterance — so Dora is never silent. `speak()`
 * is idempotent: calling it again (or `cancel()`) supersedes any in-flight or
 * playing utterance, including a slow Piper fetch that hasn't resolved yet.
 *
 * `available.value` is true when *any* output path is usable: browser
 * SpeechSynthesis OR a server-configured Piper. It starts at the synchronous
 * browser-only answer; the per-session Piper probe (deduped across
 * composable instances) flips it true async if Piper alone would work, so the
 * Settings → Voice toggle and the chat mute button appear on browsers without
 * SpeechSynthesis (FU-289).
 */
/**
 * Does the *browser* voice actually work here?
 *
 * `'speechSynthesis' in window` is not the question. Firefox ships the API
 * object on every platform but only has voices where the OS gives it some:
 *   - Firefox/Windows speaks through SAPI5, which is usually populated;
 *   - Firefox/Linux needs `speech-dispatcher` installed, and reports **zero
 *     voices** without it;
 *   - Firefox/Android has no synthesis backend at all;
 *   - Firefox honours `media.webspeech.synth.enabled`, which some hardened
 *     profiles and forks ship off.
 * In every one of those cases `speechSynthesis.speak()` is accepted and then
 * silently does nothing — no error, no `onerror`, just silence. That is the
 * reported *"TTS isn't supported on Firefox for some reason"* (owner feedback
 * 2026-08-27): not a missing API, an empty voice list.
 *
 * So the real test is "are there voices?". They also load asynchronously —
 * `getVoices()` returns `[]` on first call in Firefox and Chrome alike, and
 * only fills in when `voiceschanged` fires — so this resolves rather than
 * answering synchronously, with a timeout for the browsers that never fire the
 * event at all. Cached per session: the voice list is an OS fact, not a
 * per-utterance one.
 *
 * The answer to "what browsers can we support?" follows from this: Dora's own
 * **Piper** engine is a `POST /api/tts` returning a WAV played through an
 * `<audio>` element, so it works in *every* browser that can play audio —
 * Firefox included, and identically on all of them. The browser voice is the
 * fallback, not the floor. Where Piper is configured, Firefox is fully
 * supported; where it isn't, we now say so plainly instead of being mute.

// iOS / WKWebView audio-unlock primer.
//
// iOS Safari (and the macOS WKWebView the desktop bundle uses on Mac)
// enforce a strict user-gesture rule for `HTMLAudioElement.play()`. The
// gesture-permission "credit" is consumed the first time `play()` is
// called after user interaction, and it can be REVOKED by an intervening
// `await` that spans more than ~a few hundred ms. Two flows this bites:
//   - Dora chat reply: LLM round-trip (`await`) → Piper synth fetch
//     (`await`) → new `<audio>` → `audio.play()`. On iOS, by the time
//     we call `play()` the gesture is often gone.
//   - Cook-mode timer-fired narration: no gesture at all (timer callback
//     is not a user activation). This can't be fixed by a primer alone;
//     documented at the caller.
//
// Fix: on the first user interaction in the tab session, play a very-
// short silent muted audio blob to prime the browser's autoplay policy.
// Subsequent `Audio.play()` calls in the same session inherit the
// credit — including calls that happen across `await`s. On every other
// platform this is a harmless no-op (Chrome/Firefox/Android don't gate
// on gesture-per-play for muted audio).
//
// The silent-WAV primer + the per-element primitive both live in
// `utils/audioUnlock` now (R-003 — the settings Preview reuses them). This
// primer plays the silent blob once per session on the first gesture to prime
// iOS's per-session credit; `AudioContext.resume()` was rejected as it hits the
// same iOS gesture wall for a heavier dep.
