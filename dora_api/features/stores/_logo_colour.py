"""Derive a store's brand colour from its uploaded logo.

Shopping-list feedback 2026-08-26: *"for the 'where you'll spend it' colours
for the stores, possible to derive this from the logo uploaded? Would need to
be based on the majority/primary colour. E.g. Woolworths is majority green,
Coles is majority red."*

The derived hex lands on `Store.brand_colour` **at write time** — this runs
once per logo upload, not once per render. That keeps it a server-owned
derived fact (R-003) rather than a computation every client repeats, and it
means the shopping list's store card can colour its segments straight from
the payload it already fetches.

Why the pixel-picking is fussier than "most common colour": a retail logo is
overwhelmingly *background*. Woolworths' mark on a white PNG is ~90% white
pixels, so a naive mode returns white for every logo in existence. The filter
below throws away the two things that are never a brand colour — transparency
and unsaturated pixels (white / black / grey) — and takes the mode of what's
left. A genuinely greyscale logo has no brand colour to find, so it returns
None and the SPA keeps its deterministic hash swatch.
