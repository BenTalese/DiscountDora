"""USDA food categories, and the one question Dora asks of them.

FoodData Central classifies every food into one of 28 categories
(`food_category.csv`, e.g. "1100 Vegetables and Vegetable Products"). The
importer has always downloaded that file as part of the bundle and thrown it
away; since 2026-08-27 it stores the description on `NutritionFood.
food_category`, for exactly one purpose: deciding whether a food counts as
**fvnl** — fruit, vegetable, nut or legume — for the Health Star Rating.

**This is deliberately not `StockGroup`.** A stock group is the user's own
pantry filing system ("Frozen", "Snacks & treats"): free text, renameable, and
chosen to answer *where do I look for this*. Keying nutrition behaviour off it
would break the same rule `domain/stock_status.py` states for stock levels —
behaviour must never depend on a label a user can rename — and it would be
wrong on the merits anyway, since frozen peas are fvnl and live under "Frozen".
The two are unrelated by design (owner's call, 2026-08-27), which is why this
is its own isolated column that nothing in the UI renders.

The category descriptions below *are* safe to key on: they are USDA's fixed
vocabulary shipped inside the dataset, not something an install can edit.

# Grains and Pasta (2000), so excluding them is simply a matter of not listing
# them. Fruits and Fruit Juices does include juices, which HSR treats with more
# nuance than we can here — a splash of lemon juice in a dish reads as fvnl.

# The categories that count toward the **Nutri-Score** positive component, per
# the Updated Algorithm (2023). Deliberately a separate set rather than a
# derived one, because the difference is a published decision and not a tweak:
#
#   * **Nuts and seeds are excluded.** The 2023 update moved them out of the
#     general-foods positive component into their own calculation category.
#     They still count toward the *denominator* — a dish is not made smaller by
#     containing nuts — so this predicate only narrows the numerator. The FAQ's
#     own worked example puts numbers on it: cherries + raisins + nuts + other
#     is 46% under the original algorithm and 37% under the updated one,
#     entirely because 15 g of nuts changed sides.
#   * **Spices and herbs are excluded**, where HSR includes them. The HSR guide
#     names "spices, herbs" in the component outright; Nutri-Score instead
#     defines the component by an explicit Eurocode 2 food list (FAQ Appendix
#     2) in which culinary herbs appear individually under leaf vegetables,
#     with no blanket entry for the seasoning aisle. USDA's "Spices and Herbs"
#     category is dominated by things used in trace amounts, so the practical
#     effect is small either way, and excluding is the conservative reading.
