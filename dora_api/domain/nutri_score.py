"""The Nutri-Score algorithm, as published by Santé publique France.

Transcribed from the **Nutri-Score scientific and technical FAQ, V11
(English)** — Tables 5 and 6 and the "Calculation of the nutritional score"
method — and cross-checked, threshold by threshold, against the **official
calculation workbook** `Nutri-Score_Updated-algorithm_20240404.xlsx`
(santepubliquefrance.fr), whose *General foods* sheet is the tool European
manufacturers actually use. Nothing here is Dora's invention.

**This is the Updated Algorithm (Nutri-Score 2023), not the 2017 original.**
The distinction matters more than it looks. The official workbook computes
*both* side by side on the same sheet — columns K–U are the original, W–AE the
updated — and they disagree in ways that change letters:

  * sugars ran 0–10 on a 4.5 g step; it now runs **0–15** on its own scale;
  * sodium (mg) was replaced by **salt (g)**, 0–10 becoming **0–20**;
  * protein ran 0–5; it now runs **0–7**;
  * fibre thresholds moved (0.9–4.7 g → 3.0–7.4 g);
  * **nuts left the positive component** — see `fvl_percent` below;
  * the grade-A cut-off moved from `< 0` to **`< 1`**;
  * the original's "protein still counts if FVL scores the full 5" carve-out
    is **gone** — above the gate, protein simply drops out.

Several widely-cited third-party write-ups of "the 2023 algorithm" quietly mix
the two generations. They were not used as a source, and the one that was
checked had the grade-A cut-off wrong.

Pure and repository-free, like `domain/health_star_rating.py` and
`domain/stock_status.py`: callers pass an already-computed per-100g nutrient
profile and get a grade back.

**Scope: the general-foods table only.** The published method defines five
calculation categories — general foods, red meat, cheese, fats/oils/nuts/seeds,
and beverages — with *different tables and different grade cut-offs* (grade A is
`< 1` for general foods but `< -5` for fats and oils). A recipe is a dish, and
general foods is the residual category, so it is both the correct answer and
the default. The other four are defined by properties of a packaged product
that a home recipe has no way to assert, and guessing would move a dish between
letters on the strength of a guess.

The FAQ explicitly contemplates this use ("In the case of recipes, for example
in magazines, apps or in promotional material, the calculation is based on the
quantities and nutritional values of the various ingredients that constitute
the dish") and directs exactly here: "the algorithm for general foods may be
used".

**Three honest departures from the published method**, all forced by the
difference between a packaged product and a recipe, and all surfaced to the
user rather than hidden:

1. *Per 100 g of what.* The FAQ's recipe modality asks for ingredient values
   **as consumed** — cooked, with the yield of each ingredient accounted for.
   Dora can only sum raw ingredient weights, so a sauce that reduces reads too
   kindly and a soup made with unlisted water reads too harshly. This is a
   stated condition of the recipe modality rather than merely an accuracy nicety,
   which is why every surface labels the result an estimate. Tracked as FU-748.
2. *The ×2 weighting* the FAQ applies to dried fruit and to concentrated fruit
   and vegetables (its worked example doubles 25 g of raisins, and doubles
   tomato concentrate in a pizza) is **not** implemented. Whether an ingredient
   is dried or concentrated is not something a USDA food category can answer,
   and treating everything as neither is the conservative reading — it scores a
   recipe no better than it deserves.
3. *The red-meat protein cap* (Table 6: at most 2 protein points for red meat
   and products thereof) is **not** implemented, because deciding a dish "is
   red meat and products thereof" is a judgement about a product, not an
   arithmetic fact about a recipe. Its effect is one-directional and small —
   an uncapped red-meat dish can read at most a little better than it should.
