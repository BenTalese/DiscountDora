    /**
     * A dashboard card's "couldn't load this one" state.
     *
     * ## Why this exists
     *
     * Every one of the dashboard's slot loaders used to do
     * `catch { thing.value = null }` — with a comment explaining that the card
     * would then show its empty state. So a 500 on the savings endpoint rendered
     * *"Finish a shop and I'll tally what you kept"* to a household that had
     * shopped for months, and a failed alerts fetch rendered *"All clear —
     * nothing needs your attention right now"*. **Failure was indistinguishable
     * from absence, in the direction that reassures.** That is the Charter's
     * Honesty principle inverted, and `DASHBOARD_PAGE_REVIEW.md` §4.7 / finding
     * 10 counted eleven instances of it.
     *
     * `D-007` also wants the three states distinct: loading is a skeleton, empty
     * is `B9`'s anatomy, and this is the third — visibly *not* an empty state,
     * with the one action that can fix it.
     *
     * ## Deliberately not a toast
     *
     * One dashboard load fires eleven parallel requests. If the network is down,
     * eleven toasts is a pile-up (D-009's placement budget), and a toast also
     * outlives the thing it describes. The failure belongs *in* the card that
     * failed, so the reader can see which parts of the page they can trust.
