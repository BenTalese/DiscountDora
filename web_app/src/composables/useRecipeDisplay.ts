//
// Why it exists (R-003): the compact row view added 2026-08-17 renders
// the same recipe as `RecipeCard` in a different shape. Copying the card's
// dozen computeds into the row would mean every future wording or colour
// change had to be made twice, and the two views would silently disagree
// the first time one was missed. Both components now read from here and
// decide only *layout*.
//
// Domain facts (cookable, missing_count, kcal_is_reliable, inference_hint)
// are all server-owned and arrive on the DTO — nothing here re-derives
// them; this is presentation of data in hand.
