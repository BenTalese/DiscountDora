"""Unit tests for the Health Star Rating algorithm.

The value of this file is that it pins a **transcription**. `domain/
health_star_rating.py` is a copy of published FSANZ tables (Calculator and
Style Guide v8.1, Tables 1/4/6/7); the risk is not that the code is subtly
wrong, it's that a threshold was typed wrong, an inequality is `>` where the
guide says `≥`, or a band edge is off by one. So these tests hammer the
boundaries rather than the middles: every assertion below is a value sitting
exactly on a published threshold, or one step either side of it.
