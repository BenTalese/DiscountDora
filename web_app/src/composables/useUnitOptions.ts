/**
 * The app's unit picker vocabulary.
 *
 * `UNIT_TABLE` is generated from `dora_api/domain/units.py` and is mostly
 * synonyms — "tablespoon", "tablespoons", "tbsp" and "T" are four keys with one
 * canonical form. A dropdown built straight off it is 200 lines of the same
 * dozen units, so the list is de-duplicated by canonical form and the aliases
 * are used for *searching* instead: typing "tablespoons" finds `tbsp`.
 *
 * R-001/R-003 — this was written inside `SubstituteMetadataDialog` first; the
 * recipe ingredient editor needed the same list, so it lives here once rather
 * than being copied.
 *
 * Pass `dimensions` to narrow the vocabulary. The table spans six dimensions,
 * so the unnarrowed list offers `kJ`, `kcal`, `cm` and `ft` alongside `g` and
 * `ml` — harmless while the picker also took free text, actively wrong once
 * it's a closed list (owner feedback 2026-08-26). An ingredient is measured by
 * volume, mass or count; temperature/length/energy are recipe *metadata*, not
 * quantities.
 *
 * The list is **also** narrowed to the install's measurement system (owner
 * feedback 2026-08-27 — *"anywhere this sort of dropdown appears, units should
 * be driven by this setting"*). A metric household is not offered quarts, a US
 * one is not offered the 20 ml Australian tablespoon, and the universal cooking
 * amounts (`pinch`, `dash`, `smidgen`, `tsp`) plus the count units survive
 * every setting. Because this composable is the one place the picker
 * vocabulary is built (R-001/R-003), every dropdown in the app inherits that
 * for free — the ingredient row editor, the substitute dialog, and anything
 * added later.
 *
 * One deliberate exception, `includeValue`: a row that already holds an
 * off-system unit keeps it in its own dropdown. Recipes predate the setting
 * and an install can change its mind; silently blanking a saved `lb` because
 * the household went metric would be data loss dressed as a filter.
