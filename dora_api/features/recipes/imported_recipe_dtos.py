"""Wire shapes for the recipe importer's preview response.

These DTOs are what
``POST /api/recipes/import-from-content`` sends back after parsing a
pasted recipe. The SPA hands the same shape to its preview surface;
saving still goes through ``POST /api/recipes`` and its own
``CreateRecipeIngredientRequest`` shape.

Kept in their own module so both the parser
(``_parse_recipe_from_text.py``) and the handler
(``import_recipe_from_content.py``) can import them without circular
dependencies.
