For each product in grocy, store "search friendly product name"
Search for deals for all products in grocy that have a "search friendly product name"
Order by priority:
    1 - On grocy shopping list
    2 - Low in stock
    3 - all other deals
    4 - things not on sale
Within priority groups, order by best deals, or highlight half price, or something
Put headings for each group

Store the general product where possible in Grocy
Store specific product names as a list on the general Grocy product (is this mixing the domains?)
Get list of products from shopping list and "all products" list

REMINDER:


See summary in emails
Configurator page showing this week's deals where you can change how they are sorted (best deals, deals by category of food, etc)

Move away from Flask?

Products to test with:
    - Rice crackers             (many specific search items)
    - Apples                    (one or two generic search items)
    - Men's Antiperspirant      (one sort-of-specific search item that should match with many products and don't care which is on sale)
    - Toothpaste                (has a search item, marked as inactive product for search)

Configurator page ideas:
    - Filtering on products (is active, is hidden, has search names, etc)
    - Hide products
    - Show hidden products
