"""Owner feedback 2026-09-04 — the endpoints behind the reworked dashboard.

`/dashboard/use-it-up` and `/dashboard/restock-radar`.

**Two of the original four are gone** (owner batch, 2026-09-08). He axed the
*Shopping lists* card outright (*"useless, axe it"*) and folded *Before you
shop* into Restock radar (*"a lot of crossover … I'm inclined to axe before you
shop"*), so `/dashboard/lists` and `/dashboard/before-you-shop` were deleted
with their only consumers and their tests went with them. The one rule this
file loses in that trade is *Before you shop*'s list-membership filter, which
was not carried over — see `DORA_FOLLOWUPS.md` FU-897.

**Why these have tests when the verification stance is manual-first**
(`DORA_VERIFY_TRIAGE.md`): the stance says automate only what pins a *stable,
low-churn contract that is expensive to re-check by hand*. The card layouts are
neither — they will churn, and they are trivial to eyeball. But each of these
endpoints has exactly one rule that is invisible in a browser and expensive to
set up by hand:

  use-it-up        a recipe is listed only if it *requires* an expiring item —
                   an optional ingredient must not pull it in.
  restock-radar    only items *currently* in the band — an item that went out
                   and was restocked must drop off — and only ones that changed
                   band *recently*, which is a clock you cannot wind forward in
                   a browser.

Get any of those wrong and the card still renders plausibly, which is precisely
the failure a manual walk misses.

Delta-style like `test_dashboard_router.py`: create through the real endpoints
and assert on the rows we created, so the seeded dataset never leaks into an
expectation.
