    <!-- Owner feedback 2026-09-05, three items on the meal-slot dropdown — the
         repeated recipe name, the too-thin rows on a phone, and the two action
         icons. All three landed on TWO identical menus: `MealPlanEntryChip`
         (the desktop week grid) and `MealPlanRichCard` (the phone's day list)
         carried the same nine items, the same emits and the same comments,
         copied. Fixing one thing in two places three times over is exactly the
         duplication R-001 exists to stop, so the menu is now one component and
         the two hosts render it.

         The hosts keep their own `q-menu`-less shells; this IS the menu. -->
