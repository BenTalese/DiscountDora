/**
 * The install's measurement system — metric, imperial, or US customary.
 *
 * Owner feedback 2026-08-27: *"Locale and region settings should also include
 * units config, which then determines what units appear throughout the app …
 * anywhere this sort of dropdown appears, units should be driven by this
 * setting. For universal ones, e.g. 'dash', always include those."*
 *
 * Shaped exactly like `useMoney`, and for the same reasons:
 *   • it is **install-wide, not per-user** — a household measures in one
 *     system, the way it spends in one currency;
 *   • it arrives on `/api/health`, not `/app-settings`, because every session
 *     needs it on boot and only admins can read the settings payload;
 *   • the fetch is a module-level singleton, so N components asking produce
 *     one request and share one answer.
 *
 * Which units belong to which system is **not** decided here. That mapping is
 * `dora_api/domain/units.py`'s `UNIT_SYSTEMS`, mirrored into the generated
 * `units_table.ts` — R-003: the unit table has one source, and this is a
 * reader of it, not a second copy.
