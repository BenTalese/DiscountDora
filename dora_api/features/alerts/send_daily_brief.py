"""Daily-brief push job (owner call, 2026-08-17).

One push per opted-in user per day, at `DAILY_BRIEF_HOUR` **household-local**,
summarising tomorrow's meals and any shopping day that's due. The content is
assembled by `features/meal_plans/daily_brief.py`; this module owns only
*when* and *whether* it goes out.

Three deliberate differences from `send_alerts_push.py`, which pushes each
newly-fired alert as it fires:

  * **It's a digest, not a feed.** One notification carrying several facts,
    at a predictable hour — not N notifications whenever the evaluator
    changes its mind. That's the whole point: per-alert push is fine for
    "your milk expired", and wrong for "here's your evening".
  * **The hour is fixed, not configured.** Evening is the only hour where
    the brief is actionable (you can still defrost something or fill a gap in
    the plan), so making it a setting would add a control whose only sensible
    value is the default (Charter P1 Effortless).
  * **Silence is a feature.** A brief with nothing in it does not fire. A
    notification that arrives every day regardless is one you learn to swipe
    away without reading, which costs us the days it *did* matter.

Scheduled hourly and self-gated on the household clock rather than pinned to a
cron hour, because the scheduler is built once at startup from the *server's*
timezone while the household timezone is an AppSetting the user can change at
runtime (R-021). Self-gating means a timezone change takes effect that evening
instead of at the next restart.

Dedup rides the existing `AlertInteraction` ledger under a date-discriminated
key, the same trick `no_planned_meals` uses with its ISO-week label: one row
per (user, date), so an extra scheduler tick inside the brief hour — a restart,
a clock adjustment, a slow previous run — can't double-send.
