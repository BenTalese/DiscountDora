"""FU-596 — "Build my week" auto-planner (server-owned meal selection + placement).

The old "Plan step-by-step" builder was just the planner's recipe picker in a
modal — the user hand-picked every meal and the client spread them across days
(dropping every one into the first slot, hence FU-596). This replaces it with a
genuine *generator*: given light guidance (which days, which meal slots, an
emphasis, an optional budget cap) Dora proposes a week — the client renders it
as an editable preview and commits through the existing create/update path.

The shape the user drives is deliberately flat: two independent sets of toggles
(days, then slots) whose cross-product *is* the plan — one meal per day×slot
cell, no separate meal-count knob. `repeat_same_day` builds one day's line-up
and duplicates it across the rest.

  POST /api/meal-plans/auto-build  — preview only; never persists.

**R-003 / state-ownership:** recipe *selection* and slot/day *placement* are
cross-entity domain rules, so they live here, not in the SPA — mirroring the
`swap_suggestions.py` shape: a **pure ranker** (`select_recipes` / `place_entries`,
driven by fixtures in the unit tests) + a thin repo-touching orchestrator
(`compute_auto_build`).

**Not a Decision-7 regression:** PROPOSAL_MEAL_PLANS §3.6 cut the *"Suggest meals
I can cook now"* browse surface (that belongs on Cookbook). This is a plan
generator; it only *uses* the cookable / expiring signals to rank, it does not
resurrect a cookable-now list page.
