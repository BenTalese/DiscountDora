"""GET /api/shopping-lists — overview of every shopping list.

Each entry includes the line count, a "ticked / total" progress, the
server-owned `display_name` / `effective_date`, and exactly one entry is
flagged `is_next_up` (the list the UI should land on / mark "next"). The
ordering, naming-fallback and next-up rules are domain rules (R-003) — they
live here once, not in TS. Detail (with full lines + selected products)
lives on GET /api/shopping-lists/<id>.
