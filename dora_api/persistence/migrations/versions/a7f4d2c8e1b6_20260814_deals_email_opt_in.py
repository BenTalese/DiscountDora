"""20260814_deals_email_opt_in

Owner report 2026-08-14 — "Weekly deals is default on even if the email system
isn't set up yet." Not dev data: `User.deals_email_enabled` shipped with
`server_default=true()`, so every new user landed pre-subscribed to the weekly
deals email. On a fresh install there is no SMTP, so that is mail the server
cannot send — and the Notifications toggle is `:disable`d while SMTP is
unconfigured, so the user could not even turn it off.

Flips the column to opt-in, matching its sibling `alerts_email_enabled`
(`False` — "channels: in-app on; email off (opt-in)", PROPOSAL_ALERTS §5).
`send_deals_on_day` is untouched, so a user who opts in still gets their
preferred day back.

**Pre-release hard change — existing subscriptions are not preserved:** rows
currently set to True are reset to False. Pre-release, "subscribed" state that
nobody consciously chose isn't worth carrying, and leaving it True would keep
the exact surprise this fixes. Anyone who wants the email opts in on
Settings → Notifications.
