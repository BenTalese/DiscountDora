"""FU-653 — surfacing the Zero-Input Pantry belief beyond the stock pages.

The belief engine (`pantry_belief.py`) has always been able to say "I think
you're out of tinned tomatoes" — but only the stock overview and the stock-item
detail ever showed it. Wherever *else* a stock item is implicated (a recipe's
ingredients, a shopping list, a planned meal) the app went on reading only the
recorded level, so a recipe could sit there looking cookable while Dora quietly
believed a required ingredient had run out days ago.

This module is the one authority for that overlay (R-003). It answers two
questions, and deliberately nothing else:

  * :func:`divergent_items` — which stock items does Dora *disagree* with the
    record about, and in which direction.
  * :func:`recipe_hint` — given one recipe's ingredients, is it **at risk**
    (reads cookable, but a required ingredient is believed out) or **maybe
    cookable after all** (reads not-cookable, but every recorded-missing
    ingredient is believed back in stock).

**The overlay never changes an answer — it only ever adds a remark.** Owner
directive (2026-08-17): cookability is still computed from the recorded levels
by `domain/recipe_cookability.py`, the cookbook is never filtered on a belief,
shopping lines are never auto-added from one, and a planned meal's shortfall is
unchanged. Everything here is additive commentary the user can switch off. That
is also why it lives beside the belief engine rather than inside
`recipe_cookability` — putting it there would invite exactly the merge we're
avoiding.

**Honesty gates** (Charter P3). A remark is only made when all of:
  * the belief is a genuine inference (`is_inferred`) — not an echo of a level
    the user confirmed this week;
  * it *differs* from the recorded level (agreement is not news); and
  * confidence is medium or better — a low-confidence guess contradicting a
    recorded fact is noise, and this overlay appears on surfaces the user came
    to for a different reason.

Per-surface opt-ins live on `User` (see :data:`SURFACE_FLAGS`). The original
`inferred_pantry_enabled` keeps its meaning as the **stock** surface's toggle;
the three new ones default off, because they add remarks to pages the user
didn't ask to have annotated.
