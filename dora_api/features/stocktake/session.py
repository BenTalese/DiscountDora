"""The three-phase stocktake session.

  GET  /api/stocktake/session            — Review + Walk + Sweep, in one read
  POST /api/stocktake/session/complete   — stamp the user's session watermark

Chunk 6 / **D-4** of `docs/04_proposals/IMPL_PLAN_STOCK_SIGNAL_CONSOLIDATION.md`.
**Shrink → work → tidy:**

| Phase | Posture | Content |
|---|---|---|
| **Review** | desk | Items Dora is confident about. Agreeing is one tap. |
| **Walk** | pantry | The uncertain ones, least-certain first. |
| **Sweep** | housekeeping | Items that just dropped out of rotation. |

**Why Review comes first.** Its items are derived from *logged evidence* —
purchases and cooks — so you don't need to be standing in the pantry to agree
with them. The uncertain ones need eyes on a shelf. Splitting the two means you
walk in with a shorter list, and the two halves stop competing for one posture.

**Why this is a separate endpoint from `/queue`.** `/queue` is polled by the
stock overview on every load, for a count and a set of ids. The session needs
belief wording, a Sweep pass over the *un*engaged items, and the user's
watermark — none of which the overview should pay for on a page load. They share
every rule module (`resolve_overdue_map`, `queue_ranking`, `sweep`), so there is
still one definition of who is due and in what order (R-003); this is a second
*view*, not a second engine.

**Belief off ⇒ no Review phase**, per D-4's edge cases: that user opted out of
Dora's guesses, and opening their stocktake with a screen of Dora's reasoning
would contradict the toggle. `queue_ranking` already returns everything as
`overdue` for them, so the split falls out for free — Review is empty and the
client skips it silently, exactly as it does for the (very common, early on)
case of a household with no confident items yet.
