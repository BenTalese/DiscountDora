"""GET /api/help/food-fact — random food trivia for the help panel.

Originally the spec referenced an external food-fact RSS feed; pulling RSS
from a public list at request time is unreliable (feed shape varies, CORS
on the client, rate-limits). Instead we ship a curated local list and
rotate randomly. Trivia is light, factual, and food-themed — keeps Dora's
personality consistent.

Want more facts? Add lines to FOOD_FACTS below. Keep them under ~140 chars
so they fit the chat bubble without truncation.
