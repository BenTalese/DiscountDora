"""The canonical "does this stock item need attention?" rule.

Chunk 3b of `docs/04_proposals/IMPL_PLAN_STOCK_SIGNAL_CONSOLIDATION.md`, built
on the Step-0 answers. **One engine, server-side.** Before this, the rule
existed twice — once here as alert kinds, once in the client's
`useStockFilters.hasAlert` — and the copies disagreed in four documented ways:

  - **B1** the client hardcoded a 7-day expiring-soon window while the server
    read the configurable one, so changing the setting moved the bell and not
    the row outlines;
  - **B2** per-user `AlertPreference` was honoured by the bell and ignored by
    the rows, so disabling a kind half-worked;
  - **B3** the alerts page deep-linked to `/stock?attention=true`, a filter
    running a *different* rule than the count that was tapped;
  - **B4** non-essential out-of-stock was an actionable alert server-side and a
    dimmed row client-side — "act on this" and "ignore this" at once.

All four are the same defect: two rules for one idea. The fix is not to sync
them, it's to have one. This module is it, and `get_alerts.py` emits its three
per-item kinds from the very same predicates below — so a row's outline and the
bell's badge cannot describe different sets.

**What the rule says** (Step-0 Q1; the conditions, in severity order):

    expired          — past its expiry date                          high
    essential_low    — flagged essential AND low or out              high
    expiring_soon    — within the household's configurable window    medium

Nothing else. A non-essential item that is low or out does **not** need
attention: the row's own level band already says so, and the owner's rule for
this whole pass is *"we want people to actually pay attention when there's a
notification."* Non-essential + out still dims and sorts to the bottom (D-8) —
that's a treatment read off the level, not an alert.

The rule is evaluated **for a requesting user**, because a user can disable a
kind (`AlertPreference.enabled`) and that has to hold everywhere, not just in
the bell.

**Urgency rank** (owner call 2026-08-21). `severity` is too coarse to order the
outlined band: `expired` and `essential_low` are both `high`, so the overview's
"Needs attention" sort fell straight through to alphabetical and looked random —
an expired jar could sit below an essential that was merely low, because its
name started later. `rank` is the tiebreak, most urgent first:

    0  expired            — already gone off; the only one you can't undo
    1  essential, OUT     — you said you always want it and there is none
    2  expiring soon      — a deadline, but days of slack
    3  essential, LOW     — you can still cook; buy it on the next shop

Out beats low for essentials, and both halves of `essential_low` straddle
"expiring soon", which is why this can't be derived from the kind alone. Ranking
here rather than in the client keeps it beside the predicates it reads (R-003) —
the client sorts on the number and owns none of the meaning.
