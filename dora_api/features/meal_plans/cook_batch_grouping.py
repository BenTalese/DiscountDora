"""PROPOSAL_MEAL_PLANS_PART_2 §7 — shared cook-batch grouping + validation.

The create and update write paths both accept forward entries that may carry an
optional transient `cook_key` grouping token: entries sharing a `cook_key` are
materialised under one `CookBatch` (cook once, eat across several days). This is
the single home for the grouping + structural validation of those groups (R-003),
so the two handlers can't drift.

The functions work structurally over any object exposing `.recipe_id`,
`.scheduled_for`, `.slot` and `.cook_key` — i.e. both `CreateMealPlanEntryRequest`
and `UpdateMealPlanEntryRequest`.
