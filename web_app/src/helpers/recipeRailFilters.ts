/**
 * The recipe rail's filter chips, in one place.
 *
 * **Replaces `recipeTrays.ts`** (deleted 2026-08-30, Unit 2 of
 * BRIEF_MEAL_PLANNER_RAIL_AND_SHELL §4.3). The rail used to be four collapsible
 * accordions built by `buildRecipeTrays`; it is now one flat list plus a row of
 * mutually-exclusive filter chips, which is what F21 asked for — *"it should be
 * filterable and vertical because it's a list, and it can hold hundreds of
 * recipes."*
 *
 * **FU-578 #47 is superseded here, not regressed.** The tray builder went out of
 * its way to give each recipe exactly ONE tray: a favourite appeared under both
 * `Favourites` and `All recipes`, rendering two checkboxes in the wizard, so
 * every recipe was claimed by the highest-priority tray it qualified for. As
 * *filters* that dedupe is actively wrong — `Regulars` should list every
 * frequently-planned recipe, favourites included, because you asked for
 * regulars. Filters solve the double-render inherently: one active filter, one
 * list, so a recipe can never appear twice on screen. These are therefore
 * **independent predicates over the same fields**, with no claiming and no caps.
 *
 * R-003 — every predicate reads a **server-computed** field. `not_made_recently`
 * is the server's own 21-day household window; `plan_count` and `is_favourite`
 * are stored. The client decides nothing about what qualifies.
 *
 * The old builder also sorted its "haven't had in a while" tray by
 * `last_made_on` on the client (a `madeMs()` helper) while the server already
 * shipped the `not_made_recently` flag it selected on — an R-003 leak the brief
 * called out. That client-side recency computation is **gone**: selection uses
 * the server flag and the ordering is by name. Do not reintroduce a client
 * recency sort; if a recency *order* is wanted, the server should ship it.

/**
 * The rail's SECOND filter axis (owner, 2026-09-01: "some useful filters feel
 * like they're missing from the left rail — time of day, difficulty").
 *
 * Deliberately not more chips. The chip row is one mutually-exclusive
 * *shortlist* — "which slice of my cookbook am I browsing" — and folding two
 * more independent dimensions into it would break both its radio semantics and
 * B2a's 2-4 option guidance. These narrow whatever the chip produced, the same
 * way the search box does (L99), so they compose with it rather than compete.
 *
 * `null` on either axis means "don't narrow on this". A recipe with no
 * `time_of_day` / `difficulty` recorded is EXCLUDED once that axis is set: the
 * user asked for breakfasts, and "we don't know what this is" is not a
 * breakfast. Both fields are stored server-side against closed vocabularies —
 * `time_of_day` against the household `MealSlot` table, `difficulty` against
 * `ALLOWED_DIFFICULTY_VALUES` — so the client is matching stored strings, not
 * deciding anything (R-003).
