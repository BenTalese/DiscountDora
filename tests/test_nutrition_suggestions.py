"""Auto-suggested nutrition links — what gets offered, and what deliberately
doesn't.

The matcher's whole value is in its restraint. Suggesting "Bananas, raw" for
"Bananas" saves a search; suggesting "Toilet" for "Toilet paper" trains the user
to stop reading the suggestions, and a pantry is mostly things a food catalogue
should never answer for. So the false-positive cases below are pinned as hard as
the true-positive ones — they're the reason the recall floor exists.

The confidence *bands* are pinned too, because `is_strong` is what the bulk
"accept all" verb acts on: a name that only reaches the weak band must keep
needing a human tap.
