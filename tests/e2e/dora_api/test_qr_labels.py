"""QR label endpoints e2e (`dora_api/features/data/barcodes.py`).

  GET /api/stock-items/<id>/qr          — PNG of one item's dora:// label
  GET /api/stock-items/qr/sheet         — printable HTML sheet of many

Written to close **FU-648**, which has sat open because the owner's report
("QR button gives 'couldn't load', Print one errors") was twice fixed without
the failure ever being reproduced — the previous investigation was a static
read, and a static read is not evidence about a running server.

These endpoints qualify for an automated pin under the lean verification
stance: the contract is stable (two GETs, fixed shapes), and re-checking it by
hand means clicking through the SPA with devtools open every time. What it can
prove is that the *server* half answers correctly under a real session. What it
can't prove is how the browser reaches it — so the base-URL half of FU-648 is
still the owner's browser walk.

The sheet's QRs must be inlined as data: URIs: the SPA opens the sheet as a
blob, from which a relative `/api/...` back-reference cannot resolve and an
absolute one would be an unauthenticated subresource. That's the exact shape of
the original breakage, so it gets its own assertion.
