"""`recipe_cost._item_price` — the price of one countable item.

Owner-reported 2026-09-03: a recipe calling for "3 yolks" of an ingredient
linked to *Woolworths Free Range Eggs 12pk* (700 g, $5.50) was costed at
**$16.50** — three whole cartons — off a shelf price the breakdown displayed
as $7.86/kg. The estimator had been treating every pack as exactly one
countable thing, which is true of a tin and false of a carton of eggs, and
nothing in the arithmetic distinguished them.

These pin the replacement rule: a bare count can be priced only when the data
actually says how many items are in the pack, and is reported unpriced
otherwise. The end-to-end behaviour (the `unit_mismatch` line and the "N of M
priced" ratio it drives) is covered in `tests/e2e/dora_api/test_recipe_router`.
