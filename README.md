### Attribution
This project was started as an idea to build upon the work of [Matthew Timms](https://github.com/MattTimms) and further develop the features and capabilities of his original work [Coles vs Woolies](https://github.com/MattTimms/coles_vs_woolies). The web scraper part of Discount Dora and the main project file along with the email template are all taken from Matthew's code and are being built on top of with new ideas.
