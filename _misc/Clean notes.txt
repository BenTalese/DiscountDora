View - think of it like the mobile app built on top of the view models of oscapi
    - All static files served by the flask app
    - Vue.js
    - HTML
    - CSS

Exactly like OSCAPI:
    - View model (json response) (could be either in python or json...but might be better as python classes)
    - Framework controller (flask method) (MUST HAVE) -> json response like an API
    - Presenter (python)
    - IA controller (python)
