"""FU-534 — query-count / N+1 budget guards on the hot read endpoints.

The single most recurrent defect class in this codebase is noload / N+1
(cookbook filters, reports counts, stock-group counts, the FU-533 PATCH
bugs). Functional tests can't catch these: a page returns *correct data*
while issuing 10x the queries, then a refactor silently makes it 100x.
Rule R-032 (noload include-discipline) is the standing fix; these tests are
its automated net.

Approach — the ratio test (per `test_recipes_query_count.py`, FU-138):
seed N more of the entity an endpoint fans out over, and assert the SELECT
count grows by a small CONSTANT, not by ~N. A hard ceiling would be brittle
as new batched lookups land; "adding N rows must not add ~N SELECTs" pins
the actual invariant (no per-row query) and survives benign query-shape
shifts. Each new IN-list shard is a handful of extra SELECTs, well under
the per-entity budget below.

If one of these fails, an endpoint's hot path went from a batched lookup to
a per-row one — look for a new `for x in items: repository.get(...)` loop or
a relationship read on an un-`.include`d load (R-032) in that feature.
