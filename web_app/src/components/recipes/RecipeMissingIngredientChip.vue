         answer (D-001's out-of-stock red at the bottom, positive green at the

     * A missing ingredient's whole story, as one row-level chip.
     *
     * Was two chips — a "Missing" severity chip owned by the page and a "N
     * swaps" pill owned by this component — sitting side by side saying two
     * halves of one sentence. The owner's read (2026-08-31): *"can missing and
     * swappable be combined into one ui element somehow?"* They can, because
     * they were never two facts: "I'm out of pecorino" and "but there's grana
     * in the fridge" are one answer to one question, and the answer has three
     * possible values, which is exactly what a three-state chip is for.
     *
     *   out    (negative) — missing, and nothing recorded to use instead.
     *   swaps  (warning)  — missing, but there are recorded alternatives. All
     *                       of them are things you'd have to buy, so this
     *                       still blocks tonight; the menu says what they are.
     *   ready  (positive) — missing, but you already have a substitute in the
     *                       pantry. The row isn't blocking anything.
     *
     * The count means whatever the word beside it means: `Missing · 2 swaps`
     * counts every recorded swap (including ones you'd have to buy — that's
     * the point of showing it), `Swap ready · 2` counts the ones you actually
     * have. It's suppressed at 1 in the ready state, where it adds nothing.
     *
     * Read-only by design. Substitutes are per-cook swaps (cook mode owns
     * them) and per-item facts (the stock-item detail page owns them); nothing
     * here writes either. The menu only exists when there is something in it,
     * so the `out` state renders as a plain span rather than a dead button.
