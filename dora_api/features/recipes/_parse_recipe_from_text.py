"""Text-only recipe parser — the core of the paste-based importer.

**Chunk 2 (Class A parser)** — anchor-based extraction for sites that
publish explicit ``Ingredients`` / ``Instructions`` / ``Method`` /
``Directions`` header lines. Ships with the meta-block sweep for
Prep / Cook / Total / Servings / Yield.

**Chunk 3 (Class B fallback)** — grammar-based extraction for
Smitten-Kitchen-shaped sites (no ``Ingredients`` header). Anchors on
the first ``Serves N`` / ``Yield:`` / ``Servings:`` line; collects
ingredient-shape lines downward through the block; stops at the first
numbered step or long verb-prefixed prose paragraph. Sub-section
headers (``Sauce``, ``Meatballs``, ``For the chicken``) are skipped
in place — the current DTO has no section field, so we lose the
grouping in exchange for finding the individual ingredients.

Design notes:

* DTOs live in ``imported_recipe_dtos.py`` so both this file and the
  handler (``import_recipe_from_content.py``) can import them without
  a circular dependency.
* ``_parse_qty_unit`` grammar lives inline here — its only caller is
  this parser after Chunk 5 retired the URL-importer file.
* ``source_url`` is left blank on the returned DTO; the handler
  stamps it from the request body before responding.
* Fuzzy-matching against the user's ``StockItem`` set is NOT done
  here — the parser is pure and side-effect-free. The handler that
  wraps it does the match pass.

Style:

* Every helper below has a one-line ``### Header`` above the def that
  names the site shape it exists for. Grep-friendly if a fixture
  regresses.
* All regexes at module scope so the test suite doesn't recompile
  them per call.

    Input is what a user gets when they hit Ctrl+A / Ctrl+C on a recipe
    website and paste — page nav, story preamble, meta block, ingredient
    list, instructions, footer noise. The parser strips the noise and
    extracts the structured recipe.

    Returns the same ``ImportedRecipeDto`` shape the existing importer
    uses so downstream fuzzy-matching against the user's stock items,
    the preview surface, and the save path all stay wire-compatible.

    ``_find_steps_block`` path. When Class A finds no ingredient anchor
    (Smitten Kitchen and shape-alikes — no explicit ``Ingredients``
    header exists), the parser falls back to
    ``_find_class_b_blocks``'s grammar-based extraction.
