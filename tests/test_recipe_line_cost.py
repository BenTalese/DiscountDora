"""`recipe_cost._line_cost` — what one ingredient contributes to the estimate.

Its sibling `test_recipe_item_price` pins the *price* half (what one countable
item costs). These pin the *quantity* half: how a written ingredient meets the
unit its price is per.

Written 2026-09-09, driving a realistic recipe through the estimator line by
line. Three of the cases below were defects it surfaced:

* a cross-dimension line (a recipe in cups against a price per kilo) was never
  even attempted, because the ingredient's name — the key the density table is
  keyed on — was not passed to `units.convert` (FU-874);
* "2 sticks of celery" was billed at 226 g, `stick` being a stick of butter;
* an ingredient with no amount at all ("salt to taste") was billed as one whole
  product *and* counted toward the priced ratio.
