# Changelog

All notable changes to Discount Dora live here. Versions follow loose
semver — major bumps signal schema or breaking-config changes.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **Command palette anywhere with Cmd/Ctrl-K.** A top-of-screen palette opens
  from any page (even when an input is focused) and searches across stock
  items, shopping lists, recipes, locations, products, meals and meal plans —
  plus runs in-app commands like _Create stock item_, _Open primary shopping
  list_, _Auto-generate shopping list from low stock_, _Toggle dark mode_,
  _Show keyboard shortcuts_, and every _Go to …_ navigation. Substring and
  fuzzy matches are highlighted in the result title. Empty query shows your
  recents (last 20 entities you visited, kept per-device) and your most-used
  commands. Arrow keys move the selection, **Enter** runs it, the first
  **Esc** clears the query and the second closes. Pages can register their
  own contextual commands via `useCommands()`, auto-deregistered on unmount.
  The locations "find item" overlay now rides the same unified `/api/search`
  endpoint.
- **Keyboard shortcuts everywhere.** Press **?** anywhere to open a cheatsheet
  of every shortcut live on the current screen, grouped by area. Global keys:
  **/** focuses the Stock search (or jumps there), and **g** then **s / l / r /
  d / h** navigates to Stock, Lists, Recipes, Dashboard or Help. On the Stock
  screen, **n** adds an item, **f** focuses the filter, arrow keys move a
  highlight through the grid, **Enter** opens the focused item, and **a** adds
  the focused (or selected) items to your primary list. On a shopping list,
  arrow keys move between lines, **Space** ticks the focused line and **n** adds
  an item. Shortcuts ignore your typing in text fields, and **Esc** closes the
  cheatsheet. (Ctrl/Cmd-Z undo/redo from the undo system still works alongside.)
- **One-click Undo across the app.** A new Undo button in the header
  (tooltip shows the most-recent action label) reverses the last 20
  actions; Ctrl/Cmd-Z does the same from anywhere outside a text input,
  Ctrl/Cmd-Shift-Z (or Ctrl-Y) redoes. Destructive actions also pop a
  toast with an inline Undo for 10 seconds. Wired actions: bumping a
  stock item's level, ticking or unticking a shopping list line, moving
  / editing a stock item, **deleting a stock item** (round-trips through
  a new `/api/stock-items/restore` so the item comes back with the same
  id and references), removing a line from a shopping list, and the big
  one — **Finish shopping**: un-archives the list, rolls back the bulk
  stock-level bumps from the original ticks, and demotes whichever list
  was auto-promoted to primary, all in one click. Undoing an action that
  was processed via the offline queue works once sync completes.
- **Dora keeps working when the network doesn't.** A slim banner pins
  under the header whenever you're offline or we can't reach the server
  — with a Retry button and a live "N changes queued" counter. While
  offline, the four most common mid-shop actions (ticking shopping-list
  lines, bumping a stock item's level, marking it opened or restocked,
  pushing or clearing an expiry date) are queued in the browser and
  drained automatically when we reconnect — your optimistic ticks stay
  put in the meantime. Creates and deletes still fail loudly because
  silently inventing-or-vanishing entities is rarely what you want.
- **Errors no longer take down the whole screen.** A new error boundary
  wraps every page; if something on the page throws while rendering,
  the rest of the app (header, drawer, Dora bubble, alerts bell) stays
  alive and the page itself shows a friendly recovery card with Reload,
  Go to dashboard, and Report this (pre-fills a GitHub issue with the
  error message and a reference id). New `/errors/server` and
  `/errors/not-found` routes pick up failed lazy-chunk loads and
  in-app "not found" links respectively. Server (5xx) responses now
  surface a normalised "the server tripped" toast instead of silently
  collapsing.
- **HTTP client is harder to surprise.** Every request now carries a
  unique X-Request-Id so any error you see references back to the exact
  server log line. GETs auto-retry up to 3 times with exponential
  backoff on network errors and 502/503/504; mutations never auto-retry
  (the offline queue is the right tool for that). Every error reaching
  callers is normalised into the same shape — status, code, message,
  details, correlation id — instead of leaking raw axios objects.
- **Dora is now context-aware.** Open the chat on any screen and a fresh
  "On this page" chip row sits above the generic quick-actions, suggesting
  the 2-3 most useful next moves for that screen. On a stock item it's
  **Find cheaper alternatives** (jumps to Product Search pre-filtered),
  **Add to my list** (uses the same composable as the cart button), and
  **Find substitutes** (opens the substitutes section on the detail
  page). On a recipe: **What's missing?** (lists out-of-stock or
  untracked ingredients in chat), **Plan this for a day** (jumps to Meal
  Plans with the recipe pre-targeted), and **Add missing to a list**
  (bulk-adds the missing ingredients straight to your primary list).
  Stock overview, recipes overview, shopping list detail, my products,
  locations and the dashboard get their own contextual chips too. Every
  action routes through the same cross-feature composables (P0) the rest
  of the app uses, so behaviour stays identical wherever you trigger it.
- **Alerts panel rounded out.** Alerts are now grouped under **High
  priority / Medium / Low / FYI** headers so the eye doesn't have to
  scan for severity. Every row picks up two new actions alongside the
  existing extend-expiry / mark-restocked / acknowledge: **View in
  context** jumps you to the Stock screen pre-filtered to attention
  items, and **Snooze 7d** hides the alert on this device for a week
  (with a one-click Undo in the toast). Snoozed alerts get their own
  collapsed section at the bottom of the panel with per-row Unsnooze.
  A new bottom action — **Add N low/out items to primary list** —
  bulk-queues every low- and out-of-stock item from the panel onto your
  primary shopping list in one click (skipping anything already on it).
- **Dashboard is now the morning glance.** Four new cards sit above the
  pantry/totals strip and surface what to actually do, not just what
  exists:
  - **Needs your attention** lists the top alerts (expired, expiring soon,
    low/out, essentials low) with the same inline actions as the alerts
    panel — push expiry, mark restocked, acknowledge — and each item name
    deep-links to its stock detail page.
  - **Primary shopping list** shows the live "to grab" count, dollar
    remaining, and savings-vs-RRP total for whatever list is primary, with
    a one-tap jump-to-list. When no primary is set the card prompts you
    to pick one.
  - **Cookable tonight** lists up to three recipes that have every
    ingredient in stock right now (favourites and recently-cooked-less
    bubble up first), each with prep+cook time, servings, a deep link to
    the recipe and a "Cook" button straight into cook mode.
  - **Best deals on your saved products** ranks your saved products by %
    off, showing the merchant, the linked stock item chip, the price now
    vs the strike-through RRP, and the discount badge.
  Every chip, number, and "See more" link deep-links into the relevant
  screen (Stock, Recipes with `?cookable=true`, My Products, etc.). Cards
  can be toggled in the existing **Cards** menu.
- **Product search is now a deal-comparison surface.** Results render as cards
  with a discount badge that deepens from amber to red as the saving grows, the
  unit price (per 100g/ml or each), the merchant logo, and — for products you've
  saved — a price-trend sparkline. Each card can save to favourites, link to an
  existing stock item, or "quick-add" (saves the product, starts tracking it as
  a stock item, links them, and drops it on your primary list in one tap). Pick
  2–3 results and open a side-by-side comparison. New filters: price range,
  unit-price ceiling, size/weight range, and a half-price-or-better toggle;
  sort by relevancy, name, price, unit price or biggest saving. Merchant
  connection status badges sit up top so you can see at a glance which scrapers
  are healthy.
- **Meal plans are now a drag-and-drop week.** Drag any meal from the palette
  onto a day to plan it (cookable-now meals are flagged green), and click a
  planned entry to jump to its recipe or straight into cook mode. A sidebar
  rolls up the whole week's ingredient demand against current stock and shows
  exactly how many items you'll need to buy, with one click to generate a
  shopping list for the week. A "Suggest meals I can cook now" button surfaces
  everything fully in stock right now. (Also fixed the week's ingredient
  rollup, which was silently returning nothing.)
- **Cook mode now closes the loop on what you used.** The ingredients pane
  shows the shared stock-item chips and marks each one "used" as you tick a
  step (or advance through it) — names mentioned in a step are matched
  automatically, and you can toggle any ingredient by hand. Finishing prompts
  to update stock levels (used items step down one level), log it as a meal
  eaten, and add anything that's now low or out straight onto your primary
  shopping list. Per-step timers and voice control are unchanged.
- **Recipes overview is now a cooking command center.** Recipes are grouped
  by collection (with an "Uncategorised" bucket), every card surfaces a live
  **Cookable now** badge — or a one-click **Missing N** chip that opens an
  "add ingredients to a shopping list" dialog — and the action menu on each
  card covers cook, edit, duplicate, mark made, add all ingredients to a
  list, add to a meal plan and delete. New filters: cookable now, missing
  ≤ N ingredients, collection (incl. uncategorised), tags pulled from
  cuisine + category, and "uses stock item" (which deep-links here from the
  stock item detail page via `?usesStockItem=…`). A new **Compare** mode
  lets you pick 2–3 recipes and pop them open side-by-side — ingredients,
  times, difficulty and what's missing right now — so you can decide what
  to cook tonight at a glance.
- **Locations are wired into the rest of the app.** Clicking a zone on the
  heatmap now opens a side panel that lists every item stored anywhere
  under it (rolled up across descendants), with each chip carrying the same
  cross-feature menu the rest of the app uses — add to a list, mark
  restocked, push expiry, find substitutes, see recipes using it. Two new
  per-zone shortcuts: **Needs attention here** jumps to the Stock screen
  pre-filtered to that location's attention items, and **Shopping list**
  spins up a fresh list from every low/out item in the zone (named "Restock
  &lt;zone&gt;"). The same two actions live in the header of the zone detail
  page. The Stock screen now reads `?location_id=…&attention=true&level_id=…`
  query params so other screens can deep-link straight into a filtered view.
- **Shopping lists overview is the launchpad for every kind of list.** The
  "New list" menu now bundles every starting point in one place: from
  flagged essentials, from every low-or-out item (with a live count of how
  many that is), from a recipe (pulls the recipe's ingredients into a fresh
  list), from a meal plan (aggregates ingredients across every meal in the
  plan, scaled by servings), or from a saved template. Each card carries
  more actions — open, set primary, copy unticked → new list (active),
  copy archived → new list, archive without finishing, delete — and the
  primary list gets a richer stats strip showing remaining, full list and
  Savings vs RRP totals at a glance. The empty state recommends
  auto-generating from low/out items when stock data says there's something
  worth restocking.
- **Shopping list detail is now a shopping-trip companion.** Lines render as
  the shared stock-item chip — same level badge, alert dot, on-list
  indicator and overflow menu as everywhere else — with a per-line menu to
  swap an item with one of its recorded substitutes or move it onto another
  list. You can group lines by stock location (for a shopper's route through
  the storage areas at home) or by chosen merchant. Offer chips now mark
  your preferred merchant with a star and show how much you save vs the
  product's RRP, and the totals card carries a "Savings vs RRP" headline.
  A new **Review mode** hides unticked items and shows exactly which stock
  items will bump to Well-Stocked when you finish. Finishing a list with
  unticked items now offers to copy them straight into a new active list
  before archiving, so nothing falls through the cracks. The inline picker
  has been replaced by the shared **Quick add** sheet so the same search,
  offer-selection and frequently-added suggestions appear wherever you
  trigger it.
- **Stock item detail is now a relationship hub.** A tabbed page — Overview,
  Linked Products, Recipes, Substitutes, Lists and History — with a toolbar to
  mark open, restock, set expiry, find deals or add to a list. Linked products
  show the current deal, a price-trend sparkline and a preferred-merchant star,
  with one-click "add cheapest to list". Recipes that use the item appear as
  cards, dimmed when other ingredients are also missing. You can now record
  substitute items and swap one straight onto a shopping list, see every active
  list the item is on, and review a timeline of its stock-level changes.
- **Pantry is now the command center.** Every item row is built from the shared
  stock-item chip and surfaces its live cross-feature links inline: a location
  chip that filters to that spot, an "on N lists" chip that shows (and jumps to)
  the lists it's on, an expiry control to push or clear dates without leaving the
  page, and a "used in N recipes" badge that previews the recipes on hover. Click
  a row to peek at the full item detail in a side panel without navigating away.
  New filters for "needs attention" and "used in a recipe", and the bulk bar can
  now add to a list, move location, mark restocked or set a substitute. Empty
  state points you at building a pantry from a recipe or a shopping list.

### Added
- **First-run setup wizard.** New users (and anyone with a fresh
  `onboarding_completed_at`) land on a guarded `/welcome` route that
  walks them through five short steps: a name + theme + font picker,
  an admin "you're in charge" callout for the first user, optional
  seeding of Dora's default stock groups and locations (idempotent —
  re-importing won't duplicate), adding their first stock item with
  inline "add another" and skip, and a four-card tour with deep links
  into the screens that matter. Progress persists to localStorage so
  refresh resumes where you left off. **Skip everything** stamps the
  completion timestamp and surfaces a 24-hour "finish setting up"
  banner on the dashboard with a one-tap Continue. Settings → Account
  carries a **Restart onboarding** entry for returning users who want
  to redo the tour.
- **My Products is now its own screen.** A dedicated grid at `/my-products`
  shows every saved product with the stock item it links to (click the chip
  to jump to that item), the live deal badge, the merchant, and an
  inactive/out-of-stock marker. Filters: by linked stock item, on-deal-now,
  by merchant, plus search across name/brand/merchant/size. Bulk-select adds
  **Add all on-deal to a list** (pre-selecting the merchant offer per line),
  **Unlink** and **Mark inactive**. A "Stock items without products"
  shortcut lists every tracked item that no active product links to, with
  one-click jumps into Product Search to find a match.
- **Dedicated recipe detail / edit page.** Recipes now have a proper editing
  surface at `/recipes/:id` with a two-column layout. Each ingredient row
  is an autocomplete bound to your tracked stock items — type a name that
  doesn't exist and "Create '<name>'" inlines a new stock item without
  leaving the page — plus a live level badge, a "Missing" chip when it's
  out of stock or untracked, and a per-row "add to primary list" button.
  A sidebar carries the cooking shortcuts: **Start cook mode**, **Add all
  missing to a shopping list**, and **Find substitutes for missing
  ingredients** (uses the substitutes graph from each stock item's detail
  page — click a substitute chip to swap it straight into the recipe).
  Secondary actions (mark made, delete, mark favourite) are one click away.
- **Import a recipe from a URL.** Paste any recipe page that publishes
  schema.org/Recipe JSON-LD (which is most major recipe sites) and Dora
  pulls the name, cuisine, category, times, servings, instructions,
  nutrition and ingredients. Ingredients are fuzzy-matched against your
  tracked stock items so most rows land pre-filled; unmatched items keep
  their raw text in the notes so you can pick a match or create a new
  stock item inline.
- **Frequently-added suggestions in Quick add.** The Quick add sheet now
  surfaces the stock items you've added to a list most often — based on
  every line you've ever added — so opening it without typing puts your
  usual basket one tap away. Each frequent suggestion is starred so it's
  obvious why it's first.
- **Shared building blocks for stock and shopping actions.** Stock items now
  appear as a consistent chip everywhere — picture, live stock level, an
  on-a-list indicator and an attention dot — with a built-in menu to add to a
  list, mark restocked, push expiry, find substitutes or jump to recipes that
  use it. Products get a matching chip with the current deal and merchant. A
  global quick-add sheet lets you drop any item onto a list from anywhere,
  picking the merchant offer as you go. These are groundwork the upcoming
  screens build on, so the same action behaves identically wherever you trigger
  it.
- **Dora's chat can be backed by your own language model.** An optional,
  bring-your-own-LLM assistant: an admin enables it in **Settings → System** and
  points it at a language model they run themselves (e.g. a local Ollama),
  entering the base URL and model name. Off by default — nothing is bundled,
  downloaded, or dictated, and when it's off Dora uses its built-in rule-based
  helper. With it on, the chat understands plain-English questions about your
  data — "what's low in the fridge?", "any specials on cheese?". The model uses
  tool-calling to fetch real rows, so it can't invent items or prices.
- **Add to your shopping list by asking.** "Add 3 apples and some milk" now
  works: the model extracts the items and quantities, Dora matches each to your
  tracked stock items, and adds them to your primary list. When a name matches
  more than one item ("which milk?") she shows the options as chips and waits
  for you to pick before committing — nothing is added until you confirm. Items
  with no tracked match are reported, not invented.
- **"What should I cook?"** Dora now suggests recipes. Ask for an idea by mood
  ("something spicy", "something light") and she translates it into recipe
  terms; or ask what you can make from what you have and she ranks recipes by
  how many of their ingredients are in stock — calling out the ones you can
  make right now and what's missing for the rest.
- **Dora answers how-to and general questions too.** Beyond data queries and
  shopping-list actions, the assistant now handles "how do I…?", app-help and
  general/chit-chat messages conversationally, grounded in a guide to what Dora
  can do — so it points you to the right page (e.g. "open Product Search") rather
  than shrugging. The old rule-based replies are now only used as a fallback
  when the model isn't reachable.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-05-20

### Added — the killer loop

- **Shopping list overhaul.** Multiple lists, primary/default flag for
  quick actions, archive on completion, copy archived → new active list,
  copy unticked items to a new list. Detail page lets you tick items off,
  adjust quantity, and pick which merchant offer to buy per line. Live
  totals (remaining, picked up, full list). Finish-shopping flow archives
  the list and auto-bumps every ticked item's stock level to "Well-Stocked".
- **Stock overview filters + cart-button quick-add.** Autofocus search,
  filter chips for stock level, location, essentials-only and on-list /
  off-list. Sort menu (name, level, last-updated). Cart button on each row
  one-clicks the item onto your primary shopping list, with the icon and
  colour reflecting where the item already sits across all your lists.
  Bulk-select mode adds multiple items to the primary list at once.
- **In-app alerts.** Bell icon in the header with a live badge for
  high/medium-severity items. Slide-in panel lists everything that needs
  attention — expired, expiring soon, out/low stock (essentials called
  out separately), stocktake overdue — with inline actions (push expiry
  7 days, clear expiry, mark restocked, acknowledge stocktake). Polls
  every 60 seconds.
- **Dora now answers "what needs my attention?"** — new quick-action chip
  pulls the same data as the bell.

### Added
- **Dora help assistant.** A floating mascot (bottom-right) opens a chat
  panel with quick actions for "What can I do on this page?", "What's new?",
  "Tell me something" and more. A dedicated `/help` page surfaces guides,
  the changelog, and a random food fact.
- **Version + update detection.** Dora checks the GitHub repo for newer
  releases and surfaces an update banner when one is available.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-19

### Added
- **User & global options.** Per-user theme (System / Light / Dark with OS
  auto-follow), font family (Default / Urbanist / Nunito), and text size
  (small / medium / large). Update username and password in-app. Subscribe
  / unsubscribe to the weekly deals email and choose compact format.
- **Admin Users page.** View all accounts, toggle admin role, toggle the
  deals subscription on another user, edit username and email, and reset
  another user's password (one-time generated value, copy-to-clipboard).
- **First-user-is-admin** on fresh installs.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-19

### Added
- **Hierarchical locations.** Zones → Areas → Sections replace the old flat
  Stock Locations list. New **Locations** page with per-node heatmap
  attention scores (rolled up from descendants), reason chips ("2 expired,
  4 low stock, 1 flagged"), and a global search overlay.
- **Move items by drag-and-drop.** Drop a stock item chip onto a zone, area
  or section to move it. Click-to-move via a hierarchical picker dialog
  remains the touch/mobile path.
- **`is_admin` flag** on users; admin-only routes gated server-side.

### Changed
- Stock locations table rewritten with `parent_id`, `kind` and `sequence`.
  Pre-release migration drops existing rows.
