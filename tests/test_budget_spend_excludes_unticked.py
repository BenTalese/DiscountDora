"""Regression test for the budget's definition of "spent".

`period_spent` used to sum *every* line on an archived list. That looks safe —
surely an unbought line has no price? — but it isn't, because
`picked_offer_price` is snapshotted when a line is **added** (State-ownership
Chunk 6, `snapshot_offer_price`), not when it's ticked. So any line with a
selected product carries a price from the moment it lands on the list, and
finishing a shop with leftovers billed all of them to the household budget.

The visible symptom was two numbers disagreeing about the same shop: the list's
own receipt applies `spent_only` (`compute_list_totals`) and reported $60, while
the budget card and budget history reported $100 — and `period_headroom` fed
that inflated figure to the trim-to-budget optimiser, so the app would trim a
future list to fit money that was never spent.

This is exactly the bar `DORA_VERIFY_TRIAGE.md` sets for writing a test at all:
a stable money-correctness contract, cheap to pin, and expensive to re-check by
hand (you'd have to build a part-picked shop and cross-read two surfaces).

Isolation follows `test_daily_brief_repo.py` / `test_sqlalchemy_repository.py`:
DB env vars are pinned to a throwaway path *before* any dora_api import, and the
repository module's `db` handle is swapped for a stub bound to a private temp
engine — so this never touches the shared e2e database. It uses a real
repository rather than a fake precisely because the thing under test *is* the
query filter; a fake that ignored the predicate would pass with the bug intact.
