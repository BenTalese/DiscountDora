"""`DELETE /api/products/<id>` — remove a saved product for good.

Feedback L197 ("no way to remove a saved product") was left open for months
because a hard delete looked pointless: the companion pushed whatever a bulk
scrape returned, so anything deleted came straight back on the next push. That
is no longer true — the companion now pushes only the offers the user
explicitly saved (products program PF-1/PF-3), so Dora owns what is saved and a
delete means something.

This is the **single** delete path (PF-4). The companion's "unsave" calls this
same endpoint; there is no companion-specific back door.

What goes with the product, per owner decision D-2 — all of it by FK cascade,
already in the schema:

* `ProductOffer` / `ProductHistoricOffer` — the price history *is* the product's
* `PriceAlert` — an alert on a product that no longer exists has nothing to fire
* `Barcode` — the row is deleted outright, not orphaned (its CHECK requires one
  of product/stock item, so nulling the column would be invalid)
* `StockItemProduct` — the link, not the stock item

What survives, per D-4 (FU-883): lines on **finished** shopping lists, which
keep the product's name via the snapshot frozen at `/finish`. Lines on draft or
shopping lists are removed. Both handled by `prepare_lines_for_anchor_delete`,
shared with stock-item delete.

Unlike `delete_stock_item`, nothing blocks: a product is reference data, not
something a recipe can depend on.
