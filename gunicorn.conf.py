# Gunicorn config for the Dashy Dora self-host container (FU-397).
#
# Loaded via `gunicorn -c gunicorn.conf.py dora_api.wsgi:app` from startup.sh
# when the container runs in production. Every knob is env-driven per the
# distribution-posture checklist (RECONCILED_FINISHING_PLAN §7.5 #3) so the
# same image tunes without an edit.
#
# ── Single worker on purpose ──────────────────────────────────────────────
# The app runs an in-process APScheduler (audit-log prune, alerts digest/push,
# demo reset, snooze cleanup — see dora_api/startup.py). Those jobs must fire
# exactly once, so the default is ONE worker: one process, one scheduler, no
# duplicate emails/pushes. Concurrency comes from threads (gthread worker),
# which is the right shape for this I/O-bound Flask app in a single-instance
# self-host. Raising the worker count would duplicate the scheduled jobs — the
# fix for real horizontal scale (externalise the scheduler + split web/worker
# tiers) is parked in OPTIONAL_SAAS_AND_MANAGED_DEPLOYMENT.md, deliberately out
# of scope for the self-host release. If you set DORA_WEB_CONCURRENCY>1 anyway,
# the warning below fires at boot.
