    """P2-04 — a user's negative decision about a Dora suggestion.

    We never persist *generated* suggestions: the generators are
    deterministic and run fresh each call, so a row per suggestion would
    be churn for no payoff. We only need to remember the *negative*
    decisions the user has made — dismissed (permanent until the
    underlying condition changes) or snoozed (until `snoozed_until`).

    Dedup key is generator-defined. For "use_soon" it's the stock_item_id;
    for "frequent_waster" it's the stock_item_name; for "over_budget" the
    ISO period start. The generator's job is to choose a key that's stable
    across page-loads but specific enough that "dismiss this one" doesn't
    suppress the whole class of suggestion.
