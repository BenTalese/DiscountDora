"""20260906_shopping_line_survives_anchor_delete

FU-883 — deleting a stock item erased its lines from *completed* shopping
lists, because `ShoppingListLine.stock_item_id` / `product_id` were both
ON DELETE CASCADE. A finished list is a receipt; losing entries from it is
data loss. (The same table has always treated stores correctly:
`purchased_store_id` / `planned_store_id` are SET NULL, commented "losing a
store must not take the line with it".)

Three coupled changes:

1. `display_name_snapshot` — the line's display name, frozen at
   `POST /finish`. The name only ever lived on the anchor row, so a
   SET NULL survivor would otherwise be nameless, which is precisely why
   CASCADE was chosen originally.
2. Both anchors flip CASCADE → SET NULL.
3. `ck_shopping_list_line_anchor` gains a third clause. It demanded an
   anchor be present; nulling the last anchor of a product-only line would
   violate it and the delete would fail — **loudly on Postgres, silently on
   SQLite** (FKs off by default there), which is the divergence class that
   has bitten this repo before.

**The backfill is not optional.** Existing rows predate the snapshot, so a
line already sitting on a done list would have neither an anchor (after a
later delete) nor a snapshot, and would violate the new CHECK at delete
time. Every existing line is backfilled from its current anchor, so the
constraint holds for historic data from the moment it exists.

    It differs by how the database was built. `ck_%(table_name)s_%(constraint_name)s`

    rebuilds this table, so a migrated DB currently carries
    `ck_ShoppingListLine_` **four times** over, while one built by `create_all`
    carries it once. Hardcoding either spelling breaks the other.
