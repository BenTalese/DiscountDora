                Owner feedback 2026-08-29 — *"Still seeing 'Your browser doesn't
                expose the Web Speech API for recognition' on Firefox. What
                browsers can we really support?"*

                The honest answer, and the reason the old line felt like a bug
                report: speech *recognition* is not ours to fix from the client.
                It is the browser's `SpeechRecognition` API, which Chrome, Edge,
                Safari and the other Chromium browsers ship and Firefox has
                never shipped — there is no flag, and no polyfill that works
                without shipping audio to a third party. So the card names the
                browsers that do work rather than implying the user has
                misconfigured something. Making this work everywhere needs
                server-side transcription (FU-788), which is a real feature, not
                a copy fix.

                Speaking to Dora uses your browser's own speech-recognition
                engine, and this browser doesn't have one. It works in
                <strong>Chrome</strong>, <strong>Edge</strong>,
                <strong>Safari</strong> and other Chromium-based browsers.
                <strong>Firefox has never shipped speech recognition</strong>,
                so there's nothing to turn on here — everything else on this
                page, including Dora's voice, still works normally.

                Your browser reports no installed text-to-speech voices, and
                Dora's own neural voice isn't installed on this server either,
                so there is no engine left to read her replies. Installing the
                neural voice server-side fixes it for every browser — see

                Your browser has no text-to-speech voices installed, so the
                device voice is unavailable here — Dora uses her own neural
                voice instead, which sounds the same in every browser. This is
                the usual state on Firefox (it only speaks through voices the
                operating system gives it — SAPI on Windows,
                <code>speech-dispatcher</code> on Linux, nothing at all on
                Android) and on some hardened or minimal Linux setups.

                Owner feedback 2026-08-29 — *"I'm confused by 'Dora's
                neural-voice engine isn't installed on this server'. In what
                situations does this happen? I'd expect it to always work. Also
                if the neural voice engine isn't available then why let people
                download voices at all?"*

                Both fair. The situation is narrow and nameable: Piper is
                deliberately NOT a hard dependency (R-018 / ADR-013 — its
                `piper-phonemize` wheel won't build on Windows), so the Docker
                image installs it and the desktop bundle ships it, but an
                install running from source on a machine without it has no
                engine. That is now what the card says, instead of leaving the
                reader to guess.

                And the download cards are gone in that state rather than
                explained: offering a 60–110MB model for an engine that cannot
                run it is a dead control with a rationalisation attached. There
                is nothing to choose between while Piper is missing — replies
                fall back to the device voice automatically — so the picker only
                appears once there is a real choice to make.

                R-029 (hide, don't nag) rather than its settings-screen
                carve-out: that carve-out is for the surface that *owns* the
                config, and this page doesn't own Piper's installation — the
                binary is an operator/packaging concern whose setting lives on
                Admin → Voice, which is where the card points.

                Dora's neural voice runs as a separate engine (Piper) alongside
                the server, and this install doesn't have it. The
                <strong>Docker image</strong> and the <strong>desktop app</strong>
                both include it and need no setup; an install running from
                source doesn't, because the engine can't be installed from
                Python on Windows and so isn't a required dependency.
