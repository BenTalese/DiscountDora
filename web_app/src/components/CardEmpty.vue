    /**
     * `B9`'s empty-state anatomy, once: **feature icon (32–48px, muted) ·
     * one-line what-goes-here · optional one primary action.**
     *
     * ## Why a component rather than a class
     *
     * `.dora-empty` (in `css/dashboardCards.scss`) gives an empty state its
     * container — the sunken well, the padding, the muted `--font-size-sm`. It
     * cannot give it the **icon**, because that is markup, so every consumer
     * shipped the container without the anatomy and B9 was two-thirds unbuilt
     * wherever it was used. Ten of those consumers are on `/reports` alone.
     *
     * ## What it does not do
     *
     * It takes no default copy. B9's own example is *"Once you've restocked the
     * same things a few times, I'll flag what to keep an eye on"* — specific to
     * the surface, in Dora's voice (D-014), and a shared component that supplied
     * a fallback would invite exactly the bare "No data" the rule forbids. The
     * caller must say what goes here.
     *
     * The `#action` slot is optional and stays optional: B9's second clause says
     * **don't offer an action that lands on another empty or data-gated
     * surface** on a fresh account (FU-578 #39) — on a report, that is usually
     * every action you could think of, so most consumers here pass none and let
     * the copy carry the "fills in as you use Dora" caption instead.
