    <!-- BRIEF_MEAL_PLANNER_RAIL_AND_SHELL §4.5 — the meal planner rail's row.
         Text-first by settled decision, not preference: `RecipeRow.vue:23-27`
         records the owner call of 2026-08-18 folding the show-photos toggle into
         the cards/compact switch, so compact IS the without-photos shape; and
         `seed_builders.py` sets `image=None` on every seeded recipe, so a fresh
         install has zero recipe photos anyway. A thumbnail proposal must answer
         that seed-coverage problem first.

         Why not reuse `RecipeRow.vue`: four blockers, all structural. Its
         `compact` is derived from the VIEWPORT (`$q.screen.lt.sm`), so in a
         280px rail on a desktop it believes it has full width; its trailing
         action cluster is `flex: 0 0 auto` at ~180-200px, so only the name zone
         shrinks and the name gets ~60px; the squeeze that would fix that is
         behind `@media (max-width: 599px)`, another viewport query that never
         fires here; and its four actions are cookbook verbs, where the rail has
         exactly one — add to the targeted slot.

         What IS shared is the arithmetic: `useRecipeDisplay` is the single
         authority for the meta figures both cookbook views use, so the rail
         cannot drift from them (R-003). This component decides layout only. -->

            <!-- The meta line is now reserved for what the rail is DOING.
                 Browsing shows nothing: the "35m / 620 kcal" figures were
                 deleted 2026-09-01 (owner: "remove the extra row of info from
                 the recipe rows"). They are cookbook facts — you pick a meal
                 for a slot here, and the recipe page and the cookbook both
                 carry them properly. Suggesting carries Dora's reason.

                 Targeting used to name the destination on EVERY row ("→
                 Breakfast"), which the owner asked for on 2026-09-03 to be
                 removed: *"I don't like the '→ Breakfast' text on every
                 recipe."* One armed slot has one destination, so repeating it
                 down forty rows is the same fact forty times — it is named once
                 now, in the picker's target line above the list (which the same
                 batch made a single inline row rather than a banner). -->

                 calories are cookbook facts you don't pick a slot on; that
                 stands. But a list ordered cheapest-first with no figure on it
                 asks you to take the order on trust, and "what the rail is

        <!-- F26 / F42 / FU-088 — the cooked-pool controls for batch households,

             "I like the style of the +/- count for quantity on shopping lists.
             Make a mini version of that here"). Same contract as
             `ShoppingListPlanRow`'s: a tile at rest, steppers on approach, the
             buttons always in the layout so revealing them cannot reflow the
             row. Mini because a 44px tile in a rail row would out-weigh the
             recipe name; the tile is 30px.

             The third button — "Log a cook…", which opened a count dialog —
             is gone with its dialog (owner: "log a cook on the left rail feels
             unnecessary; remove the button to get back horizontal space and
             delete the modal"). Nothing is lost: `+` logs one cooked meal,
             which is the common case, and the recipe page owns a real cook.

             The cluster stops both click and keydown: the row itself answers a
             click, Enter and Space with "add this recipe to the armed slot", so
             a key typed into the count must not reach it. -->

                 way?"* Neither: the click landed (the cluster stops propagation
                 to the row), it just had nothing to do on a mouse - arming the
                 steppers is a touch-only affordance, and on hover they are
                 already there. A number you can click and cannot change is a
