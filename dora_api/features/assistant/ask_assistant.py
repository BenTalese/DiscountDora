"""POST /api/assistant/ask — the SLM-backed Dora assistant.

Uses native function-calling (Ollama `tools`). One model turn decides whether
the message needs data (and calls a tool) or can be answered directly:

  1. If the model is unreachable, return `available=false` so the frontend
     falls back to its rule-based intents — nothing breaks when Ollama is off.
  2. Send the message + tool schemas. The model either:
       - returns `tool_calls` -> we run the tool deterministically and feed the
         results back for a grounded final answer; or
       - returns plain content -> that IS the answer (how-to / general / chat),
         grounded by the app guide in the system prompt.
  3. An add-to-shopping-list tool call is intercepted and turned into a
     non-mutating `pending_action` plan instead of being executed.

The model never reaches the database directly — see features/assistant/tools.py.
