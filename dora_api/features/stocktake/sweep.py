"""The Sweep phase's rule: which items *newly* dropped out of rotation.

Chunk 6 / **D-4** of `docs/04_proposals/IMPL_PLAN_STOCK_SIGNAL_CONSOLIDATION.md`.

The engagement gate (`stocktake._is_engaged`) quietly excludes any item showing
no current sign you keep it. That's correct and it is *most* of what makes the
queue tolerable — the tin you stopped buying two years ago is **supposed** to be
invisible. So the Sweep phase must not be "here is everything excluded": that
list is long, boring, permanent, and re-nagging you about it every session is
precisely the behaviour this plan exists to remove.

What's worth a glance is the **event**: something you *were* tracking has just
stopped being tracked. A handful per session at most, and it decays to zero for a
stable pantry.

**How "newly" is decided without storing history.** The gate's two time-windowed
signals both expire on a known schedule: an item falls out
`_ENGAGEMENT_WINDOW_DAYS` after its last level change or last shopping-list
appearance, whichever is later. So the drop-out moment is computable from the
events themselves:

    dropped_out_at = latest_engagement_event + ENGAGEMENT_WINDOW

and an item is *newly* excluded when that instant is **after the user's last
session** and not in the future. No schema history, no nightly job, and the
answer can't drift from the gate because it's derived from the same two events
the gate reads.

**Deliberate exclusions from the Sweep:**

* **Items with no engagement events at all.** Never tracked, rather than newly
  untracked — surfacing those is the "here's everything" failure mode above.
* **Items still engaged.** Obviously; the gate answers this and we re-ask it
  rather than inferring from timestamps.
* **Everything, on a user's first ever session** (`last_session_at is None`).
  Otherwise the phase's debut would dump every long-dead item into it, teaching
  the user in one shot that this screen is noise.

**Copy note carried from D-4:** never "dead items" — it judges something the
user may still care about. The phrasing is *"Dora's stopped tracking these"*.
