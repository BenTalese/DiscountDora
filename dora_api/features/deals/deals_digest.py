"""Weekly deals digest — *what* the email says (FU-789).

Split from `send_deals_email.py` on the same seam as
`meal_plans/daily_brief.py` / `alerts/send_daily_brief.py`: this module owns
the content and the policy (which deals qualify, how they're worded, when a
send is due), the job module owns delivery. Everything here is a pure function
over plain values so the policy can be tested without a DB, a clock or an SMTP
server.

Three decisions worth stating, because each one is a place the feature could
have quietly misled someone:

  * **Silence is a feature**, same as the evening brief. A week with no active
    specials sends nothing rather than an empty "no deals this week" mail. An
    automated email that arrives regardless of whether it has anything to say
    is one you stop opening, which costs us the weeks it mattered.
  * **No images.** Product images are served from an authenticated endpoint
    (`GET /products/<id>/image`), and an email client has no session — an
    `<img>` pointing at it renders a broken box for every recipient, forever.
    The expanded format earns its name with layout and detail (store, size,
    both prices, the saving), not pictures. The settings copy says so.
  * **Every price is the install's own ingested data.** Dora does not look
    anything up to build this; if the companion tool stops pushing product
    data, the digest goes quiet on its own rather than mailing stale specials,
    because a product with no current offer never scores.
