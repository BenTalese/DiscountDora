# Changelog

All notable changes to Discount Dora live here. Versions follow loose
semver — major bumps signal schema or breaking-config changes.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **Stock item detail is now a relationship hub.** A tabbed page — Overview,
  Linked Products, Recipes, Substitutes, Lists and History — with a toolbar to
  mark open, restock, set expiry, find deals or add to a list. Linked products
  show the current deal, a price-trend sparkline and a preferred-merchant star,
  with one-click "add cheapest to list". Recipes that use the item appear as
  cards, dimmed when other ingredients are also missing. You can now record
  substitute items and swap one straight onto a shopping list, see every active
  list the item is on, and review a timeline of its stock-level changes.
- **Pantry is now the command center.** Every item row is built from the shared
  stock-item chip and surfaces its live cross-feature links inline: a location
  chip that filters to that spot, an "on N lists" chip that shows (and jumps to)
  the lists it's on, an expiry control to push or clear dates without leaving the
  page, and a "used in N recipes" badge that previews the recipes on hover. Click
  a row to peek at the full item detail in a side panel without navigating away.
  New filters for "needs attention" and "used in a recipe", and the bulk bar can
  now add to a list, move location, mark restocked or set a substitute. Empty
  state points you at building a pantry from a recipe or a shopping list.

### Added
- **Shared building blocks for stock and shopping actions.** Stock items now
  appear as a consistent chip everywhere — picture, live stock level, an
  on-a-list indicator and an attention dot — with a built-in menu to add to a
  list, mark restocked, push expiry, find substitutes or jump to recipes that
  use it. Products get a matching chip with the current deal and merchant. A
  global quick-add sheet lets you drop any item onto a list from anywhere,
  picking the merchant offer as you go. These are groundwork the upcoming
  screens build on, so the same action behaves identically wherever you trigger
  it.
- **Dora's chat can be backed by your own language model.** An optional,
  bring-your-own-LLM assistant: an admin enables it in **Settings → System** and
  points it at a language model they run themselves (e.g. a local Ollama),
  entering the base URL and model name. Off by default — nothing is bundled,
  downloaded, or dictated, and when it's off Dora uses its built-in rule-based
  helper. With it on, the chat understands plain-English questions about your
  data — "what's low in the fridge?", "any specials on cheese?". The model uses
  tool-calling to fetch real rows, so it can't invent items or prices.
- **Add to your shopping list by asking.** "Add 3 apples and some milk" now
  works: the model extracts the items and quantities, Dora matches each to your
  tracked stock items, and adds them to your primary list. When a name matches
  more than one item ("which milk?") she shows the options as chips and waits
  for you to pick before committing — nothing is added until you confirm. Items
  with no tracked match are reported, not invented.
- **"What should I cook?"** Dora now suggests recipes. Ask for an idea by mood
  ("something spicy", "something light") and she translates it into recipe
  terms; or ask what you can make from what you have and she ranks recipes by
  how many of their ingredients are in stock — calling out the ones you can
  make right now and what's missing for the rest.
- **Dora answers how-to and general questions too.** Beyond data queries and
  shopping-list actions, the assistant now handles "how do I…?", app-help and
  general/chit-chat messages conversationally, grounded in a guide to what Dora
  can do — so it points you to the right page (e.g. "open Product Search") rather
  than shrugging. The old rule-based replies are now only used as a fallback
  when the model isn't reachable.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-05-20

### Added — the killer loop

- **Shopping list overhaul.** Multiple lists, primary/default flag for
  quick actions, archive on completion, copy archived → new active list,
  copy unticked items to a new list. Detail page lets you tick items off,
  adjust quantity, and pick which merchant offer to buy per line. Live
  totals (remaining, picked up, full list). Finish-shopping flow archives
  the list and auto-bumps every ticked item's stock level to "Well-Stocked".
- **Stock overview filters + cart-button quick-add.** Autofocus search,
  filter chips for stock level, location, essentials-only and on-list /
  off-list. Sort menu (name, level, last-updated). Cart button on each row
  one-clicks the item onto your primary shopping list, with the icon and
  colour reflecting where the item already sits across all your lists.
  Bulk-select mode adds multiple items to the primary list at once.
- **In-app alerts.** Bell icon in the header with a live badge for
  high/medium-severity items. Slide-in panel lists everything that needs
  attention — expired, expiring soon, out/low stock (essentials called
  out separately), stocktake overdue — with inline actions (push expiry
  7 days, clear expiry, mark restocked, acknowledge stocktake). Polls
  every 60 seconds.
- **Dora now answers "what needs my attention?"** — new quick-action chip
  pulls the same data as the bell.

### Added
- **Dora help assistant.** A floating mascot (bottom-right) opens a chat
  panel with quick actions for "What can I do on this page?", "What's new?",
  "Tell me something" and more. A dedicated `/help` page surfaces guides,
  the changelog, and a random food fact.
- **Version + update detection.** Dora checks the GitHub repo for newer
  releases and surfaces an update banner when one is available.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-19

### Added
- **User & global options.** Per-user theme (System / Light / Dark with OS
  auto-follow), font family (Default / Urbanist / Nunito), and text size
  (small / medium / large). Update username and password in-app. Subscribe
  / unsubscribe to the weekly deals email and choose compact format.
- **Admin Users page.** View all accounts, toggle admin role, toggle the
  deals subscription on another user, edit username and email, and reset
  another user's password (one-time generated value, copy-to-clipboard).
- **First-user-is-admin** on fresh installs.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-19

### Added
- **Hierarchical locations.** Zones → Areas → Sections replace the old flat
  Stock Locations list. New **Locations** page with per-node heatmap
  attention scores (rolled up from descendants), reason chips ("2 expired,
  4 low stock, 1 flagged"), and a global search overlay.
- **Move items by drag-and-drop.** Drop a stock item chip onto a zone, area
  or section to move it. Click-to-move via a hierarchical picker dialog
  remains the touch/mobile path.
- **`is_admin` flag** on users; admin-only routes gated server-side.

### Changed
- Stock locations table rewritten with `parent_id`, `kind` and `sequence`.
  Pre-release migration drops existing rows.
