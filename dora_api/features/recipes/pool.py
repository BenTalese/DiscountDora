"""FU-317 Chunk 2 — the one authority for `Recipe.available_meals` mutation.

**One write-site, one floor rule.** Every caller that changes a recipe's
pool count goes through `bump_pool`. The historical drift (a raw SQL
CASE-WHEN in the sweep + inline `_Recipe.available_meals = …` in each
handler) collapses to a single primitive here.

Concretely this closes an R-003 drift called out in the FU-317 proposal
§5.1: the sweep and `cook_recipe`/`adjust_recipe_meals` used to encode
the floor-at-zero rule independently — one in SQL, two in Python. If
one ever changed and the others didn't, the pool would silently disagree
with itself.

`bump_pool` accepts an optional connection so the same code path serves
both worlds:

- **ORM callers** (`cook_recipe`, `adjust_recipe_meals`) pass no
  connection and let the UPDATE run on the current Flask-SQLAlchemy
  session; the `save_changes()` at the end of the handler commits it
  alongside any other ORM work. Any already-loaded `Recipe` entity's
  Python `available_meals` attribute becomes STALE after this call —
  callers should read the returned int, not the entity attribute.

- **The connection-level sweep** (`reconcile_consumed_meals`) passes its
  own decoupled connection so the update participates in the sweep's
  own transaction, not the per-request ORM session.

`RETURNING available_meals` gives us the post-update value in one
round-trip, which lets us honour the floor without a follow-up SELECT.
The SQL is portable to both SQLite ≥ 3.35 and Postgres.

    - `recipe_id` may be a `UUID`, a `str`, or the raw `bytes` shape
      SQLite stores for `UUIDType` columns. The bind shape is
      backend-dependent: SQLite stores the column as BINARY(16) so a
      raw-text() bind must be `bytes` (a str form won't match); Postgres
      stores it as native `uuid`, which rejects a `bytea` bind
      (`operator does not exist: uuid = bytea`) but accepts the canonical
      string form. We normalise to a `UUID` first, then bind `.bytes` on
      SQLite and `str(...)` on Postgres.
    - `connection` is a SQLAlchemy `Connection` object; when omitted the
      update runs on `db.session` and is committed by the caller's
