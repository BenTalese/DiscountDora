"""P8-08 — The Dora Score.

A single, honest, explainable kitchen-health metric derived from five
signals over a rolling 30-day window (§P8-08 in
``docs/01_charter/DASHY_DORA_CHAMPION_PLAN.md``). Renders on the
dashboard as one composite number + a per-component breakdown + a
trend arrow (score vs. same score computed 7 days ago).

Design shape follows **R-027 + ADR-023** — a pure decision core with
no repository or DB access. The endpoint handler
(``features/dashboard/get_dora_score.py``) gathers the raw inputs and
delegates to :func:`compute_score` here. The same pattern is already
used for :mod:`buy_verdict` and :mod:`pantry_belief`; keeping the
score consistent with them means the unit tests never need a
database.

Charter guardrails baked in:

* **P3 Honest** — a component that has no data in the window is
  *excluded* from the mean (its weight goes to zero), not treated as
  zero. A user with no budget set doesn't drag the score down; a
  user with no waste tracking gets a 4-signal score, not a fake 5th.
* **P1 Effortless** — the score never nags; the frontend renders it
  as a positive-framed number ("you're at 72") with actions that
  *improve* the weak component, never "you failed at X".
* **R-003** — the score itself, the components, and their thresholds
  live server-side. The client renders whatever the server hands it.
* **R-010** — the component keys form a closed set (see
  :class:`DoraScoreComponentKey`). No stringly-typed enums.
