"""Download Piper voice models on demand into the runtime voices dir.

Voice models aren't shipped in the repo (~60 MB each). When a user picks a
voice in onboarding / Settings → Voice, the SPA calls
`POST /api/tts/voices/<id>/download`, which kicks off a background download
here: fetch the `.onnx` + `.onnx.json` from the catalog's pinned HuggingFace
URLs into `<voices dir>`, verify the `.onnx` against the catalog SHA-256, and
atomically move it into place. `GET /api/tts/voices` reports each voice's
state so the UI can show Download / Downloading… / Ready / Retry.

State is process-local (an in-memory set + last-error map). That's fine: the
*file on disk* is the source of truth for "ready" (any worker sees it), and the
download status is only a transient UI hint while a fetch is in flight. A
second download request for an already-in-flight voice is a no-op. A worker
reload mid-download loses the in-flight bit but leaves the `.part` file behind;
the atomic rename means a partial file never reads as "ready", so the next
request just kicks off a fresh download (the `.part` is overwritten in place).

Two resolution paths:
- `<data dir>/voices/<filename>` — where downloads land (read-write). The
  user's choice, survives across upgrades.
- `<bundle dir>/voices/<filename>` — the build-time-bundled default voice in
  shipped artifacts (Docker image + desktop installer). Read-only. Populated
  by `packaging/fetch_default_voice.py`, never present in git. Checked as a
  fallback so a fresh install can speak Dora's neural voice immediately
  without the user clicking Download first.
