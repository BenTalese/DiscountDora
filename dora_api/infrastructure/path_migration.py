"""D2 — one-time migration of legacy on-disk locations into the
config-driven layout.

Runs on dora_api startup. Each migration is idempotent: if the
destination already has the file it stays put and the source is left
alone (operators may have intentionally repopulated it). Source files
move (not copy) so duplicates don't leak.

What it covers:
  - Legacy `./data/dora.data.db` when the user sets
    `DORA_DB_URL=sqlite:///<elsewhere>` or `DORA_DATA_DIR` to a
    different location — files migrate once. Only called when the
    resolved DB URL is SQLite; Postgres has nothing to relocate.
  - Legacy `./data/uploads/*` → `<DATA_DIR>/uploads/*`.
