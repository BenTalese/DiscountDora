     * The app's single-select control.
     *
     * Exists to make ONE decision in one place: menu or dialog on mobile.
     * Before this, all 72 `q-select`s left `behavior` unset, so every one took
     * Quasar's default — and that default is **user-agent based, not viewport
     * based** (`$q.platform.is.mobile`, QSelect.js `updatePreState`). So a
     * desktop browser dragged to phone width still gets an anchored menu while
     * a real phone gets a full-screen dialog; you cannot see the mobile
     * behaviour by resizing. Meanwhile the tri-state filters render their own
     * `q-menu` and are never dialogs. Hence the owner's report: "most dropdowns
     * open a modal, but our custom ones behave normally."
     *
     * The rule, rather than a blanket flip either way:
     *
     *   short, closed vocabulary  → `menu`   (Difficulty, Theme mode, cadence…)
     *   long list, or `use-input` → `default` (dialog on mobile, menu on desktop)
     *
     * Because the two cases genuinely differ. A five-option menu anchored to a
     * field is faster and less disruptive than a modal takeover — that's the
     * style the owner prefers, and there's no reason a phone should get a
     * full-screen surface to pick "Easy / Medium / Hard". But a long or
     * typeahead list needs the room and needs to survive the software keyboard,
     * which is exactly the problem the dialog exists to solve; forcing those
     * into an anchored menu on a phone would trade a mild annoyance for a
     * genuinely cramped one.
