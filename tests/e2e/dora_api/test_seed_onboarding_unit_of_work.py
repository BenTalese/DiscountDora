"""FU-512 — `POST /onboarding/seed` is a unit of work.

Pre-FU-512 committed after the groups block AND inside the locations loop
after each zone insert. Now: one final commit at the end of the handler.
The locations loop still calls `flush()` before inserting child locations
(child.parent_id → zone_entity.id, and the classic mapper has no
`relationship()` between StockLocation self-refs, so SQLite FK checks would
trip without the flush — the local contract in
`sqlalchemy_repository.py:57-67`).

Happy-path only: the seed loops iterate parsed JSON and don't naturally
raise. A rollback test would need a test-only override of `_load_seed` to
return a poisoned entry; deferred.
