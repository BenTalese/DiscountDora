REMINDER:


See summary in emails
Configurator page showing this week's deals where you can change how they are sorted (best deals, deals by category of food, etc)

Move away from Flask?

Products to test with:
    - Rice crackers             (many specific search items)
    - Apples                    (one or two generic search items)
    - Men's Antiperspirant      (one sort-of-specific search item that should match with many products and don't care which is on sale)
    - Toothpaste                (has a search item, marked as inactive product for search)

Configurator page ideas:
    - Filtering on products (is active, is hidden, has search names, etc)
    - Hide products
    - Show hidden products


Ability to search and pick which product to add from merchant (so grab list of products that come up based
off search, like a test search and user can pick, which then picks and saves the product by ID)
