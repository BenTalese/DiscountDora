class StockItemPriceObservation(BaseEntity):
    """A single "what this cost me" price point on a stock item — the everyday
    price-history substrate (PROPOSAL_PRODUCTS_AS_OVERLAY §3.2 / FU-227 chunk 2).

    **Folded shape (A1 ratified 2026-06-22):** the user logs the TOTAL price
    they paid + the TOTAL measure they got + the unit. Per-unit cost is
    derived server-side (``get_stock_item_unit_cost_at``); the client never
    divides (R-003). Count is *not* stored — it's a UI input that contributes
    to ``total_measure`` and ``total_price`` at entry time (cleaner canonical
    truth; no "two 12-packs vs one 24-pack" ambiguity — see plan §6a).

    **Provenance via FK, not enum (A4 revised):** when harvested from a
    completed shopping line, ``shopping_list_line_id`` points at that line
    (ON DELETE SET NULL — provenance only, not a sync link per LC-4). When
    typed manually, the FK is null. Partial UNIQUE on the FK (per LC-1)
    makes harvest idempotent under finish-button double-taps. The old
    ``source`` enum field is gone — the FK carries strictly more info.

    **Optional store_id (A2):** populated when the user picks a store on the
    shelf-price widget, or carried over from a shopping list's store at
    harvest. Lets the widget surface "Last seen at Coles" without a separate
    `usual_store` lookup. ON DELETE SET NULL.

    Gated by the money/spend feature at the surfaces (the UI), not by
    Products. Ingestion **never** writes observations (chunk 7 — observations
    are an in-app user-input substrate only).
