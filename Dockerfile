# Monolithic dev/prod image. Phase D / FU-186: dora_api runs alongside
# nginx serving the built SPA. The retailer-scraping `merchant_api` +
# the deals `emailer` live in the sibling **dora-companion** repo now.
# See compose.yml for the runtime story + nginx.conf for the SPA host
# config.

# System packages:
#   nodejs (NodeSource 22) — frontend build (Quasar/Vite). Debian Bookworm's
#                   apt only ships Node 20, but @quasar/app-vite 2.6+ requires
#                   Node 22.22+, so we pull Node 22 from NodeSource instead.
#                   Bump the setup_NN.x line when Quasar next raises the floor.
#   nginx         — D1: replaces `quasar serve` for serving the static
#                   SPA in the runtime container.
#   curl          — used by the HEALTHCHECK directive below (+ fetching the
#                   NodeSource setup script).

# Piper neural-TTS engine for Dora's voice. Installed here, NOT pinned in
# requirements.txt (R-018 / ADR-013): piper-tts can't install on the Windows
# desktop build, so it would break `pip install -r requirements.txt` there —
# but the Linux container ships it so the neural voice works out of the box.
# Voice models are downloaded on demand into the data volume via Settings →
# Voice (features/tts/voice_provision); if this install ever fails the app
# still runs and falls back to the browser voice.

# ── Frontend deps. Critical: install inside /app/web_app so `quasar build`
#    can find node_modules there. We copy the WHOLE frontend project (not just
#    package*.json) before `npm install` because @quasar/app-vite runs
#    `quasar prepare` as an npm `postinstall` hook, which aborts unless the
#    Quasar project files (quasar.config.js, src/) are already present. Trade-
#    off: editing any frontend file now busts the npm-install cache layer —
#    acceptable for a self-host image built infrequently. `.dockerignore`
#    excludes node_modules/dist so the host's aren't dragged in. ─────────────
