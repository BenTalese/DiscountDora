"""Nutrition complex-mode endpoints — source status, dataset import, matching.

    GET  /api/nutrition/sources                  — what can answer a lookup now
    POST /api/nutrition/datasets/import          — start a bulk import (admin)
    GET  /api/nutrition/unmatched-items          — unlinked items + suggestions
    POST /api/nutrition/suggestions/accept-all   — link every confident match

Status is deliberately a *read of reality* rather than a stored flag: a
dataset is "available" iff it holds rows. The transient import phase is
in-memory (the import runs on a daemon thread), so a server restart mid-import
reports `idle` with whatever rows had been committed — honest, and recoverable
by starting again.
