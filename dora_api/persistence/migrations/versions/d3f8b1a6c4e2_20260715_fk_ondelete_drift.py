"""20260715_fk_ondelete_drift

FU-565 (from the FU-393 data-model sanity sweep, Finding 4) — 6 foreign keys
declare an ``ondelete`` rule in the ORM model that the migrated production schema
never had (created before the ondelete discipline, as anonymous FKs, and never
altered). This is a real correctness gap on BOTH engines — SQLite runs with
``PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON`` (see dora_api/app.py), and Postgres enforces natively —
so e.g. deleting a StockLevel referenced by a StockItem should SET NULL (model)
but instead errors, and deleting a Store a Product points at should be RESTRICTed
(model) but isn't.

Reconciled to the model:
  * ProductOffer.product_id          -> Product  CASCADE
  * ProductHistoricOffer.product_id  -> Product  CASCADE
  * Product.store_id                 -> Store    RESTRICT
  * StockItem.stock_group_id         -> StockGroup    SET NULL
  * StockItem.stock_level_id         -> StockLevel    SET NULL
  * StockItem.stock_location_id      -> StockLocation SET NULL

Changing an FK's ondelete is a constraint recreate → a table rebuild on SQLite
(``batch_alter_table``), a native DROP/ADD CONSTRAINT on Postgres. The reflected
anonymous FKs are named via the metadata NAMING_CONVENTION on the rebuild, and
we wrap the names in ``batch.f(...)`` so the convention isn't applied a second
time (the double-render trap documented on c5a8e1f7d3b2). The batch rebuild
reflects + recreates every other column, FK, and index on these tables, so
StockItem.usual_store_id (already SET NULL) and the FU-563 covering indexes are
preserved.
