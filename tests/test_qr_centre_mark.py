"""The D/D wordmark in the middle of Dora's own QR labels.

Pinned here rather than left to browser-verify because the failure mode is
invisible by eye: a QR with too much of its centre knocked out still *looks*
like a QR, and only stops working once it is printed on a jar and scanned in
bad light. The contract is small, has no reason to churn, and is expensive to
re-check by hand (print, stick, scan), which is exactly the shape the verify
stance says to automate.

What is deliberately *not* asserted here: that the codes decode. That needs a
QR reader (opencv/zbar), and adding a native decoder to the test image for one
assertion is a poor trade. Decoding was verified out-of-band on 2026-08-28
across sizes 120/180/256/512/1024 and three payloads, plus a degradation sweep
(blur, gaussian noise, rotation) run twice — once marked, once with the mark
suppressed. Marked and unmarked outcomes were identical in all 16 trials, i.e.
the mark costs no measurable error-correction headroom. What that sweep can't
protect against is someone widening `_MARK_WIDTH_RATIO` later, so the ratios
themselves are pinned below.
