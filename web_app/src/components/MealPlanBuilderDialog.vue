         properly on mobile". `min-width: 560px` won against `max-width: 95vw`

                         cost of the meals: `apply_budget_cap` sums each chosen
                         recipe's full ingredient value, pantry or not, and
                         swaps the dearest for something cheaper until the week

                                 diagnosis: the row stacked under
                                 `@media (max-width: 599px)`, which keys off the
                                 VIEWPORT while the row lives in a ~600px
                                 dialog, so a 1280px desktop kept the ~400px
                                 horizontal control cluster and left the name
                                 column whatever remained — a long name then
                                 painted straight through the selects.

                                 The row is stacked at EVERY width now: the name
                                 owns its own line, the controls own theirs. A
                                 dialog is not a viewport and there is no width
                                 at which cramming both onto one line was
                                 working. That also frees the swap button, per
                                 the owner's suggestion — the name IS the swap
                                 control (a button, so it is focusable and
                                 announced), which is one fewer 36px cell in the
                                 cluster that was overflowing.

                                 Owner 2026-09-12 — the row became a card and
                                 lost a line. The swap glyph beside the name is
                                 gone (the name is still the swap control, and
                                 the tooltip still says so); the servings
                                 stepper and the delete button moved up onto the

                                 horizontal space; and the two selects keep the
