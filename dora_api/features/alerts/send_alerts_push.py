"""C-9.8 — Alerts web-push job.

Hourly tick. For each user with at least one active push subscription,
evaluates the canonical actionable set (`GetAlertsHandler` — R-003,
same source the in-app hub and email digest read), then pushes every
**newly-fired** alert (not present → present in the ledger, dedup'd via
`AlertInteraction.last_pushed_at`) to every browser the user has
subscribed.

Per-channel dedup mirrors C-9.7's email pattern: stale-flag cleanup at
the top of each user's iteration resets `last_pushed_at` for any key
that's no longer in the user's known set, so a later re-fire pushes
fresh. The same row's `last_emailed_at` is independently managed by
the email job — the columns don't interact.

When a push fails permanently (HTTP 404/410 — browser unregistered or
permission revoked), the subscription row is deleted so we don't keep
retrying it forever.
