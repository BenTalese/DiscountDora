    /** A price field (feedback PH-4).
     *
     *  The app had five hand-rolled money inputs and no agreement between
     *  them: some put the currency symbol in the *label text*
     *  (`"Notify me below ($)"`), `PriceEntry` used `prefix`, and none of them
     *  normalised what the user typed. The owner's note was *"formatting of
     *  the number input doesn't seem right. Should format to a decimal, no?
     *  Let's do what is standard for a price input."*
     *
     *  So: the symbol is a **prefix**, not label text — it stays visible while
     *  typing, and it stops the label growing long enough to truncate in a
     *  narrow card (which is what PH-3 was reporting). And the value settles to
     *  two decimals on blur, so `3` becomes `3.00` and `2.999` becomes `3.00`
     *  rather than being sent as-is.
     *
     *  Rounding happens **on blur, not on every keystroke** — normalising as
     *  the user types fights them mid-entry (typing "3.5" would rewrite to
     *  "3.50" before they finish).
     *
     *  D-006 (one formatting authority): the symbol comes from `useMoney`, the
     *  install-wide money policy, never a hardcoded "$".
     *
     *  **Adoption is deliberately partial.** This landed with Price History
     *  (batch G); the other money inputs — `PriceEntry`,
     *  `ShoppingListPlanRow`, the dashboard budget and Money settings — are
     *  still hand-rolled and are tracked for a sweep rather than migrated
     *  blind inside a UI batch.
