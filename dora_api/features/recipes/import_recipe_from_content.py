"""POST /api/recipes/import-from-content — parse a pasted recipe.

IMPL_PLAN_RECIPE_IMPORTER §Chunk 5 — replaces the pre-Chunk-5
``POST /api/recipes/import-from-url`` fetcher. The server no longer
makes outbound HTTP requests: the user hands us the recipe text
(Ctrl+A / Ctrl+C / Ctrl+V from the recipe page in their browser) and
we parse it locally. Closes:

* **FU-104** (URL importer legal posture) — no companion split needed;
  the fetch moved to the user's browser via paste, so the operator of a
  hosted Dora instance no longer touches third-party sites.
* **FU-199** (SSRF in import-from-url) — closed by construction. There
  is no outbound HTTP call in this file; there is no host / redirect /
  scheme to validate.

Flow:

1. Client posts ``{content, source_url?}``.
2. ``parse_recipe_from_text`` (Chunks 2-3) turns ``content`` into an
   ``ImportedRecipeDto``.
3. This handler resolves cuisine + category vocab against existing
   rows (read-only; no creation) and fuzzy-matches each ingredient's
   ``raw_text`` against the user's ``StockItem`` set (RapidFuzz, score
   threshold 70 — unchanged from the FU-196 swap).
4. ``source_url`` is stamped onto the DTO as metadata. Never fetched.

Saving still goes through ``POST /api/recipes`` and its own
``CreateRecipeIngredientRequest`` shape — Chunk 4 made that route
accept either ``stock_item_id`` (linked) or ``raw_text`` (unlinked),
so an ingredient that missed the fuzzy threshold round-trips as
unlinked all the way through save.
