"""Auto-matching a stock item to a nutrition food — as a *suggestion*.

The owner's ask (2026-08-15): "people don't like having to manually input data
and set stuff up. If a stock item isn't linked to any nutrition data, auto
search and best-match on the name and show it as a suggested link — accept,
ignore, or search yourself. It shouldn't get in the way, and it should be
obvious it's a suggestion."

This reverses nothing about P12 No-invent, and the distinction is the whole
design: a score computed here is **never written**. `StockItem.nutrition_food_id`
is still only ever set by a human pressing Accept (or picking through the
existing lookup). What changed is that the human is now shown a candidate
instead of being handed an empty search box, and every suggestion travels with
the number that produced it so the UI can label a weak guess as a weak guess
(P3 Honest).

**Local catalogue only.** Suggestions never call Open Food Facts or the USDA
API: this runs across the whole pantry at once, so a live source would mean
hundreds of round-trips through an endpoint already known to flap, and a
suggestion that takes six seconds to arrive is worse than no suggestion. The
manual picker keeps its full multi-source search — that's the "search yourself"
path, and it's the one place a live source is worth the wait.

Scoring is deliberately a readable formula rather than a fuzzy-match library
(R-019 No-magic): the reason a row scored 0.62 has to be explainable to the
person deciding whether to trust it.
