"""FU-538 — audit-coverage completeness sweep.

WHY THIS MATTERS: test_audit.py proves ONE mutating route emits an audit event
and that scrubbing works — but there's no guarantee the OTHER ~160 mutating
method/route pairs do. Audit gaps are silent (nothing breaks; the trail is
just missing) and only discovered during an incident when the row you need
isn't there. This is the audit analogue of test_route_auth_enforcement.py's
sweep: pin the contract "every state-changing (POST/PATCH/PUT/DELETE) /api
endpoint either emits an AuditEvent or is on an explicit, commented
exempt-set".

HOW AUDIT ACTUALLY WORKS (read dora_api/infrastructure/audit.py +
middleware.py): auditing is a SINGLE global `after_app_request` hook
(`auto_audit_after_request`). It emits exactly one row for every mutating
/api/* request whose response status is < 400, EXCEPT endpoints named in
`audit._NO_AUDIT_ENDPOINTS`. So the skip logic lives in ONE place; this
sweep's exempt-set (`AUDIT_EXEMPT` below) is pinned to be the *mutating
subset* of that real set — we do NOT invent a parallel allowlist.

TWO complementary layers, mirroring the auth sweep's runtime-url_map shape
(routes register inside startup(), so app.url_map is empty at collection time
→ everything here is a RUNTIME loop, never a collection-time parametrize):

  * STRUCTURAL (covers all ~160 pairs): every mutating /api rule's endpoint
    is either middleware-audited (not in _NO_AUDIT_ENDPOINTS) or in the
    explicit AUDIT_EXEMPT set — and AUDIT_EXEMPT is kept in lockstep with the
    real _NO_AUDIT_ENDPOINTS (no rot, no parallel invention).
  * BEHAVIOURAL (a tractable subset): actually drive a broad set of mutating
    endpoints to a 2xx and diff the AuditEvent table before/after, asserting
    exactly one new row that carries the actor user_id, a non-empty action,
    and a scrubbed payload. This is what proves the middleware genuinely
    fires end-to-end (not just that the endpoint name isn't on the skip list).

WHAT'S EXCLUDED FROM THE BEHAVIOURAL SWEEP (and why) — these are still pinned
by the STRUCTURAL layer, they're just impractical to drive to a clean 2xx:
heavy/side-effecting or hard-to-build-a-valid-body routes (backups
create/inspect/restore, spreadsheet import, chunked uploads, ingestion batch,
reconcile, cook, assistant ask/act/confirm, tts synth/voice download, meal-
plan template application, auth email/password flows, admin user CRUD). See
`_EXCLUDED_FROM_BEHAVIOURAL` for the full annotated list.

CONVENTIONS: module-level `requests.*` = authenticated admin client (the
seeded "dora" account); per-test DB rollback is automatic. The behavioural
sweep is ONE test that loops many mutations — that's fine, rollback happens
once at teardown.
