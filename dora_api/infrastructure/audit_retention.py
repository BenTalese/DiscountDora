"""Nightly job that prunes AuditEvent rows older than RETENTION_DAYS.

Wired in startup.py via APScheduler. Job is no-op when the table is
empty and never raises (a failure here must not take the API down).
The retention window is `AppSetting.audit_retention_days` (default 365);
the legacy `DORA_AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS` env var still works as a fallback
during the FU-333 Bucket B deprecation window.
