    <!--
        The recipe's front-of-pack rating, whichever scheme this install picked
        (owner ask 2026-08-27; redesigned 2026-08-28).

        **Health stars are a score pill, not five inline stars.** The original
        rendered all five glyphs at 14px directly in the card's chip run, and
        the owner's note was "the star rating looks a bit meh" — correctly. At
        that size the signal is carried by *which* glyphs are filled, and on a
        low-rated recipe that means four-and-a-half grey outlines: 75px of
        width spent saying almost nothing, in a row where every neighbour is a
        chip. The pill says the same thing in one glyph and a number, and the
        full five-star render moves into the hover, where there's room for it
        plus the caveat.

        **Nutri-Score keeps its badge.** The A–E strip is already a compact
        pill and the colour is the signal, so there is nothing to compress —
        wrapping it in a second pill would only add chrome.

        This exists because `RecipeCard` and `RecipeRow` rendered the same
        block twice already, and adding a per-scheme branch would have made it
        the same block *four* times — the point at which a second copy stops
        being cheap and starts being where the two quietly diverge (R-001).
        The cookbook's two densities differ only by which host places it.
