    <!--
        "Uses N expiring" chip, coloured by URGENCY rather than by count.

        Owner feedback 2026-08-18: with one flat amber, a recipe using 4
        ingredients that go off next week looked exactly as pressing as one
        using 2 that go off today — and sorted above it. The cookbook now ranks
        on the soonest date (server-derived, `expiring_soonest_date`), and this
        chip shows the same fact so the ordering is legible rather than
        mysterious.

        One chip, not a card-only detail panel: the compact rows need the same
        signal, and a shape that only works in one view would put the two
        cookbook layouts back out of step. The breakdown that a panel would
        have shown lives in the tooltip.
