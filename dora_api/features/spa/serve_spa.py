"""Serve the built SPA from Flask.

Used ONLY by the desktop bundle (`desktop_app.py`), where pywebview's
window points at Flask and there's no nginx in front. For the Docker
and `quasar dev` paths these routes are wired but never reached
(nginx / Quasar's dev server intercept everything before Flask sees
it).

Path resolution:
    1. `DORA_SPA_DIR` env var — set explicitly (PyInstaller bundle
       passes the unpacked location via `desktop_app.py`).
    2. `<repo-root>/web_app/dist/spa` — CWD-relative fallback for
       running `python -m dora_api.startup` from a checkout that's
       already built the SPA.

vue-router uses history mode, so every URL that doesn't map to a
static file must serve `index.html` and let the client router take
over. The catch-all route is intentionally LESS SPECIFIC than the
`/api/...` blueprints, so Werkzeug's routing picks the API ones
first; the catch-all only ever fires for SPA paths.
