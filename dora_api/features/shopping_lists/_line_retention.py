"""What happens to shopping-list lines when their anchor is deleted (FU-883).

The rule has two halves, and only one of them can live in the schema:

- **Done lists are receipts and keep their lines.** The FKs are ON DELETE
  SET NULL, and `display_name_snapshot` (frozen at `POST /finish`) keeps the
  orphaned line readable.
- **Draft and shopping lists drop the line entirely.** A line you can no
  longer buy is noise on a list you are about to shop, and those lists carry
  no historic value.

A foreign key cannot express the second half — it can't branch on the parent
list's status — so deletion happens here, before the anchor row goes and the
database applies SET NULL to whatever is left.

Callers: `stock_items.delete_stock_item`, and product delete when batch C
lands. Both pass exactly one of the two ids.

    Two steps, in order:

    1. **Delete** the lines on draft/shopping lists.
    2. **Snapshot** any surviving (done-list) line that still has no name.

    Step 2 is a backstop, not a duplicate of the finish-time snapshot. A list
    can reach `done` without passing through `POST /finish` — the dev seed
    writes finished lists directly, and a restore does too — and such a line
    has no name to fall back on. Nulling its last anchor would then violate
    `ck_shopping_list_line_anchor` and fail the whole delete with a 500. This
    is the last moment the name is still reachable, so it is the right place
    to guarantee the invariant rather than trusting every writer to have done
    it. Finish-time stamping still matters: it captures the name as it was at
    purchase, where this captures it as it is now.

    Does not commit — the caller's `save_changes()` covers this and the anchor
    delete in one transaction, so a failure can't leave the lines deleted but
    the anchor standing.
