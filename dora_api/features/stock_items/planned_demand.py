"""Planned demand — "the plan needs this, and you haven't got it".

Owner, 2026-09-03, asked whether one of Dora's belief metrics was based on how
many planned meals a stock item is involved in, reasoning that it would be a
good indicator when an item is Low or Out. Read literally as a *belief* input
it is wrong, and instructively so: planning to cook rice on Thursday tells you
nothing about how much rice is in the cupboard today. It is a statement about
**demand**, not about the shelf — a different question, on a different clock,
from the one `pantry_belief.py` answers.

So it is its own signal, computed here, and the two are deliberately never
mixed. The belief says *what you have*; this says *what you are going to need,
and by when*. They are only interesting together, which is where the sentence
the owner asked for comes from:

    "3 planned meals in the next fortnight need Rice (2 already covered by
     cooked batches) — the first is Thursday, and you're Low."

**Coverage comes from the shared pool model** (`meal_plans/planned_meals.py`),
so the batch-cooking variant the owner described — *"2 have been allocated a
meal"* — is the same allocation the shortfall report uses rather than a second
guess at it (R-003). A household that doesn't batch-cook has an empty pool and
every planned meal counts, which is the right degenerate case.

**Only required, linked ingredients count.** An optional ingredient is not
demand (the same rule `recipe_cookability` applies), and an unlinked one has
no stock item to attach to.

**Urgency is a function of the recorded level, and Out outranks Low** (owner:
*"Out would be higher confidence than low"*). An Out item with planned meals
against it is a hard blocker — the meal cannot be cooked — whereas a Low one
is a warning that it might not stretch. That grading is exposed as `urgency`
rather than left for each caller to re-derive from `level + count`, which is
how a domain rule ends up written four times in two languages (R-003).

This is a **plain fact about the user's own plan**, not an inference, so
unlike the belief overlay it is not gated on the inference opt-outs. It is
gated on the meal planner being switched on at all: with no planner there is
no plan, and the signal is vacuous rather than merely off.
