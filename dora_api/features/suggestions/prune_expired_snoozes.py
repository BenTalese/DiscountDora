"""Periodic job that prunes elapsed snoozes from DoraSuggestionSuppression.

Wired in `startup.py` via APScheduler. Runs daily. Dismissed rows are
permanent (they're the user's "never remind me" decision until the
underlying condition changes) — only snoozed rows whose `snoozed_until`
has passed are eligible.

Historically this cleanup ran inline on every `GET /api/suggestions`
request, taking a write lock on the hot dashboard read path. Moved
out of the request path per FU-513 (2026-07-08): the read filter in
`suggestions._is_suppressed_now` already ignores expired snoozes, so
correctness never depended on inline pruning — the table just needs an
occasional sweep so it doesn't accrete stale rows.
