"""Shared write-time meal-slot validation (C-2.A, R-003 / R-010).

`MealPlanEntry.slot` and `Recipe.time_of_day` hold the slot *name* as free
text (no FK). New writes must match the household `MealSlot` vocabulary; any
legacy/off-vocab string already stored is preserved (deleting a slot leaves
those labels intact). The vocabulary + its validation live on the server only
— callers ask here rather than re-deriving the allowed set.

**"New writes" means new VALUES, not new requests** (owner report 2026-09-01:
"getting errors 'could not update the plan' after fiddling with the meal slot
settings"). Deleting a slot deliberately leaves existing labels intact, but
every update endpoint validated its whole payload against the live vocabulary
— and the planner resends the entire forward-entry set on every edit. So one
preserved "Snack" entry made the whole week unsaveable, and the promise that
deleting a slot is non-destructive was only true until the next edit. Callers
that are UPDATING an existing record therefore pass what that record already
holds to `allowed_slot_names`, which keeps a genuinely new off-vocab slot
rejected while letting a record carry its own history forward.
