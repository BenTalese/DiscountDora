"""GET /api/meal-plans/shortfall — which recipes still have to be cooked.

The pool-vs-commitments model this reports on lives in `planned_meals.py`
(2026-09-03, R-003). This module used to own a raw-SQL copy of it —
`SUM(e.servings) > r.available_meals`, grouped by recipe — which was correct
but could only ever answer the recipe-level question. The per-entry reading
("*which* of the three planned fried rices is already covered") was needed for
the stock surfaces' planned-demand signal, and two implementations of one
domain rule is the thing R-003 exists to prevent, so both now read the same
allocation.

Behaviour is unchanged: a recipe appears when its committed servings exceed
its cooked pool, and `shortfall` is still that difference. `earliest_needed`
is now the earliest *uncovered* entry rather than the earliest entry full
stop — a strictly better answer, and the same one whenever the pool is empty,
which is every household that doesn't batch-cook.
