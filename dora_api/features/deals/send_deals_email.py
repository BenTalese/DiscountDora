"""Weekly deals email job — *when* and *whether* it goes out (FU-789).

Built 2026-08-29. Until then this feature was a settings toggle, four database
columns, an admin column and a health flag with **nothing behind them** — no
job, no sender, no template — so subscribing set a boolean nothing read.
`startup.py` had even been siting the audit sweep "well clear of any
deals-email schedule" for a schedule that was never registered.

Shaped after `alerts/send_daily_brief.py`, for the same reasons and with the
same seams:

  * **Registered hourly, self-gated on the household clock.** The scheduler is
    built once at startup from the *server's* timezone, while the household
    timezone is an AppSetting the user can change at runtime (R-021). Gating
    inside the job means a timezone change takes effect that week rather than
    at the next restart.
  * **Dedup rides the `AlertInteraction` ledger**, under a week-scoped key —
    the same trick the daily brief uses with its date-scoped one. One row per
    (user, ISO week), so a restart, a slow previous run or a clock adjustment
    inside the send hour cannot mail the same deals twice. Reusing that table
    rather than adding one keeps this feature migration-free.
  * **Nothing to say ⇒ nothing sent, and nothing stamped.** A week with no
    active specials does not send an empty mail, and does not burn the ledger
    row either — if the companion tool pushes data at 07:20 the mail should
    still go out on the next tick within the hour.

The gate chain, outermost first: SMTP configured → the install's
`deals_email_enabled` flag → the household send hour → per-user opt-in, active
account and a *verified* address → this user's chosen weekday → a non-empty
digest.
