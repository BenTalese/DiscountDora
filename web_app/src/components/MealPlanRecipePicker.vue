            <!-- S3 — targeting. The destination is named at BOTH ends (here and
                 on the slot itself): at 1280px+ the rail and the targeted day
                 are far apart, and naming both ends is the reliable version of
                 drawing a connector between them.
                 `role="status"` makes it a live region, so arming a slot is
                 *announced*, not only drawn — the pulse is visual-only and this
                 is its screen-reader equivalent.

                 Owner feedback 2026-09-03 — this was a filled `q-banner`, and
                 two complaints landed on it at once: *"don't like the current
                 big box that appears at the top shifting the UI so much"* and
                 *"replace the box at the top with a simple Done button and '→
                 <meal slot> <date>' text inline with each other"* — plus a
                 preference for the styling the rows had been using: *"I do like
                 the bold green text on the recipe cards for it, better styling
                 than what's in the top box."* So: one line, the arrow-led
                 destination in accent-bold beside its button, and the ~44px the
                 banner used to insert above a scrolled list is now ~28px.

                 The button says **Done**, not Cancel (owner, same batch:
                 *"cancel makes you think you'll undo the meals you added to
                 that slot"*). It never undid anything — it disarms the slot —
                 and "Done" is what disarming means once you have added
                 something. -->

                 A SECOND axis rather than two more chips: the chip row is one
                 mutually-exclusive shortlist and these two are independent

            <!-- Owner 2026-09-05 — *"no way to filter recipes on estimated
                 cost."* This is a ranking rather than a filter, deliberately: a
                 cost *filter* needs bands, and a band boundary ("under $3 a
                 serving") is a domain constant this client doesn't own and
                 shouldn't invent. Cheapest-first answers the same question —
                 "what can I plan that's cheap?" — out of figures the server
                 already ships, and it is the same ordering the cookbook's
                 Cost-per-serving sort produces (one comparator, R-001).

                 Two options, so `BaseSegmented` is the right primitive (B2a
                 sanctions it at 2-4). Money-gated install-wide: with money off
                 the server sends no cost at all, so the control would sort
                 every recipe by null. -->

    // for the child through a template ref, but the child mounts as a result of
    // that very state change, so the ref was still null when the call was made
    // — and measured in the browser, focus never moved at 300ms OR at 1500ms.
    // Owning it here means `onMounted` runs when this component's own DOM
    // exists, which is exactly the guarantee that was missing.
    //
    // Two entry points, because the rail may be either closed or already open:
    // mounting with a target set (the rail just opened for it), and a target
    // arriving/changing while mounted (you re-armed a different slot).

    // the modal"). The row's `+` still logs one cooked meal through
    // `paletteMealAdjust`, and a real cook belongs to the recipe page.
