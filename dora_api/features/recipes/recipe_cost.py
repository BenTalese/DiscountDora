"""Server-owned recipe cost estimation (R-003 — one definition of "what a
recipe costs", never duplicated on the client or across features).

Extracted from `get_recipes._compute_estimated_cost` (C-4 Chunk 9 / DEC-5) so
both the recipe-detail endpoint and the FU-451 budget-defense swap ranker
price recipes the same way. The single-recipe path preserves the original
behaviour exactly; the batch path prices many recipes in **two queries total**
(one offer lookup, one observation fallback) rather than 2×N — important for
the swap ranker, which costs the whole candidate pool at once.

Pricing ladder per ingredient (PROPOSAL §3.2):
  1. cheapest linked-product current offer → unit price (price_now / size_value)
  2. else the stock item's price-observation unit cost (FU-216 substrate)
  3. else unpriced (contributes nothing; surfaced via the priced/total ratio)

**Counting the contents of a measured pack (feedback 2026-09-03).** The same
category error survived on the counted side. `pack_amount` — the price used
when a recipe says "2 tins" or a bare "3" — was set to the offer price for
*every* product, including one whose size is a mass or a volume. So "3 yolks"
of an ingredient linked to *Free Range Eggs 700 g @ $5.50* priced as three
whole 700 g cartons: **$16.50**, off a shelf price of $7.86/kg, which is the
owner's report. A measured pack does not say how many countable things are
inside it — nobody recorded what one egg weighs — so a bare count can no
longer be priced from one. Where the count *is* recorded the answer is better
than it was: `pack_count` ("4 × 125 g") and a count-dimension size ("12 ea")
both give a genuine per-item price, and a `dozen` is divided by twelve rather
than sold whole. Everything else is reported unpriced.

**Unit reconciliation (feedback 2026-08-19).** It used to be pass-through —
the ingredient quantity was multiplied by the unit price whatever the two
units were. That is not a rough heuristic, it's a category error: a price of
"$4.20 per bottle" times "200 ml" produced $840, and the seed's two-ingredient
Juice Bowl reported **$1590**. Every price now carries the unit it is per, the
ingredient quantity is converted into that unit, and an ingredient whose units
can't bridge (200 ml of a thing priced per bottle — we don't know the bottle's
size) is reported **unpriced** rather than guessed at. Unpriced ingredients
already have a home in the UI: the "N of M priced" ratio. An honest gap beats
a confident wrong number.

    Recipes measure ingredients two different ways and each needs a different
    half of the price:

    * **By measure** — "400 g of tomatoes", "2 cups of juice". Convert the
      quantity into the unit the price is per, then multiply. A conversion
      that can't bridge dimensions (200 ml of a thing priced per bottle: we
      don't know the bottle's size) is **unpriced**. Guessing here is what
      produced the $1590 Juice Bowl.
      Mass↔volume is the one cross-dimension bridge, and it needs to know
      *what* is being converted — 250 ml of oil and 250 ml of honey are 50 g
      apart. The ingredient's name is passed for that (FU-874): until
      2026-09-09 it was omitted, so `units.convert` refused every mass-vs-volume
      pair and a recipe measured in cups against a product priced per kilo read
      as unpriced no matter how well the density table knew the ingredient.
      This does not soften ADR-073 — an ingredient the table doesn't list still
      returns None and is still reported unpriced.
    * **By the item** — "2 tins", "1 onion", or a bare "2". Multiply by the
      price of one countable item. Permissive about the unit itself: "tins"
      isn't a unit we know and doesn't need to be, because the count is all the
      arithmetic needs. But the *price* side has to be a real per-item figure —
      a pack measured in grams doesn't say how many items are in it, so that
      combination is **unpriced** rather than billed as whole packs (feedback
      2026-09-03; see `_item_price`).
      Two exceptions, both added 2026-09-09 after driving a real recipe through
      this function. `units.SUB_ITEM_UNITS` names the words that mean a *part*
      of a shelf item — "3 cloves" was being billed as three whole bulbs
      (FU-904) — and those are never counted. And a counted ingredient with no
      per-item price can still be priced from its **weight**, when the pantry
      knows what one of them weighs.

    `portions` is that last piece: the linked food's measured household
    measures, when the caller has them. With them, "2 leeks" against a per-kilo
    price is 178 g rather than unpriced, and one cup of flour weighs the same
    here as it does on the nutrition panel (FU-905). Without them — no dataset
    imported, no food linked — every path falls back to exactly what it did
    before.
