// The one implementation of "open a server-rendered document in a new tab".
//
// It exists because the mechanic is two rules deep and both are easy to get
// wrong in ways that only show up somewhere you aren't:
//
//   R-045 — the document lives behind `/api/*`, so it must be fetched through
//   `AxiosHttpClient`, never handed to `window.open` as a URL. A bare
//   `window.open(apiUrl)` carries the session only if the browser volunteers
//   the cookie, which it declines cross-site and cannot do at all in the
//   Capacitor shell. It works perfectly on a dev box and 401/404s in a real
//   deployment.
//   R-046 — but fetching first is what breaks the open: a `window.open` that
//   can't be attributed to the click is blocked outright on mobile. So the tab
//   is opened synchronously, inside the caller's own call stack, and navigated
//   to the blob when the fetch lands.
//
// Extracted 2026-08-19 from `useQrLabels.openQrSheetAsync` when the recipe
// Print button turned out to be an un-swept R-045 violation of the same shape
// (reported as "Print button 404s"). Any future print view calls this.
