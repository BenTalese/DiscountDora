    /*
     * Thin wrapper around q-btn-toggle so every single-select row of buttons
     * in the app shares one anatomy: a pill-shaped sunken track with the
     * active segment as a brand-primary pill inside it. Pass dense / spread /
     * size etc. through as normal attrs — Vue's default inheritAttrs forwards
     * them onto the root.
     *
     * **The pill used to be opt-in and is now the only shape** (owner,
     * 2026-09-03: *"I've found a couple instances of single select option rows
     * of buttons that are inconsistent with the latest designs … update [them]
     * to be styled like recipe view's step style picker"*). It arrived as a
     * `pill` prop on 2026-08-31 for that one call site; four of the nineteen
     * consumers had since adopted it and the rest hadn't, which is exactly the
     * split the owner walked into. A shape prop with a clear winner is not a
     * variant, it's a migration that never finished — so the prop is gone and
     * the squared block with it (D-015).
     *
     * `rounded` + `unelevated` are set here rather than at the call sites for
     * the same reason: they are part of the anatomy, not a per-site choice.
     * Call sites that used to pass `flat`, `color="grey"`, `text-color` or
     * `toggle-text-color` had those removed in the same pass — `flat`
     * suppresses the active fill (which is why two of them then hand-painted
     * it back), and the grey/white pair is a hardcoded palette R-002 forbids.
     *
     * The anatomy's values are tokens (`--seg-*` in tokens.scss), shared with
     * `settings/DoraSegmented.vue`, which is the same control drawn as a
     * hand-rolled radiogroup. Two mechanisms, one anatomy; merging them is
     * FU-848.
