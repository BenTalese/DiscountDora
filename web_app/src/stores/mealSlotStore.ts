// **R-003 — every write goes through here, including the settings page's.**
// Until 2026-09-01 `RecipeMealSlotsSettings.vue` talked to the api service
// directly while this store kept a `hydrated` short-circuit, so a slot added,
// renamed or deleted in settings was invisible to every other surface until a
// full page reload. Two owner-reported bugs came out of that single seam:
// the planner's "which slot?" list not honouring settings until a refresh, and
// "could not update the plan" errors after editing slots — the planner armed a
// slot name that no longer existed, and the server's write-time vocabulary
// check (`slot_validation.py`) rejected it. A store that caches must own the
// invalidation; a caller that mutates behind the cache is the bug.
