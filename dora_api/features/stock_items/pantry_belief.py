"""P8-07 — The Zero-Input Pantry belief service (FLAGSHIP).

Server-owned (R-003) confidence-weighted belief about each stock item's
level, inferred from the closed loop instead of manual logging:

  • intake  (P6-01) — the last purchase anchors the belief to Stocked and
    starts a fresh depletion clock.
  • cadence (P6-04) — the typical gap between purchases estimates how long
    a fresh buy lasts.
  • cooking (P6-07) — consumption events draw the belief down faster than
    the calendar alone would (cooking three times this week is not an
    untouched week).
  • time decay — the longer since any hard signal, the lower the confidence
    and the more the belief drifts Stocked → Low → Out.

Charter alignment (Part II):
  1 Effortless — replaces manual logging; the user maintains nothing.
  2 Coarse-by-design — a BAND (Out/Low/Stocked), never a fake exact count.
  3 Self-correcting & honest — every belief carries a confidence + a plain
    reason; thin data yields low confidence, never a confident wrong answer.
  5 Leverage the loop — reads purchases + cooking + cadence together.
  7 Explainable — the `reason` is the "why" the UI surfaces.

Manual override wins (P8-07 spec): a recent `last_checked_at` (the user
confirming the level) pins the belief to the recorded level at high
confidence — inference never argues with a fresh human check.

The core (`compute_belief`) is a **pure function** of gathered inputs so
it is unit-testable without a database; the `gather_*` helpers do the repo
access. All thresholds below are coarse and deliberately tunable — the
point is a robust band, not false precision.
