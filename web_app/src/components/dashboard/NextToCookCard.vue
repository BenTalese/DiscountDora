    /**
     * The next few meals worth cooking, each flagged missing-N when it isn't
     * cookable (feedback L272, FU-298).
     *
     * **Which meals those are depends on how the household cooks** (owner,
     * 2026-09-04). The page selects; this renders. In a fresh household plan
     * day is cook day, so the selection is the next planned meals in order. In
     * a batch one the plan is not a cook schedule — one batch covers many
     * planned days — so the selection is the meals somebody actually has to
     * cook: the pool's shortfall, plus meals marked cook-fresh, which stand
     * outside the pool in both directions.
     *
     * **2026-09-08 — the row lost three of its five channels.** The owner:
     * *"Next to cook is too dense especially on mobile. Reduce it to recipe
     * name, the day (today/tomorrow/Wednesday/etc) only, missing ingredients
     * chip, a proper cook button that is icon only on mobile. This removes text
     * like 'dinner - serves 2 to cook <chef hat icon>'."* So:
     *
     *   · **the slot** came off the when-label. It read "Tomorrow dinner"; the
     *     day is what tells you whether this is urgent, and the slot is the one
     *     word on the row that changes nothing about what you'd do next.
     *   · **`serves N`** went. It was added on 09-05 so the row couldn't promise
     *     a number cook mode then contradicted — but the honest fix for that was
     *     making `cookPlannedMeal` open at the same figure, which it does. The
     *     number is stated on the screen that uses it.
     *   · **the pool state** (`to cook` / `fresh` / `already cooked`) went. It
     *     was already redundant by construction after the same 09-04 batch
     *     taught the *page* to filter on those flags: a batch household only
     *     ever sees rows that are `needs_cooking` or `cook_fresh`, so the label
     *     was the row's own premise printed back at it — the same reasoning that
     *     retired the "Ready" badge on 09-05. `useBatchEnabled` is still read,
     *     because the two empty states genuinely differ.
     *
     * What survives is the row's three real channels: what it is, when it is,
     * and whether you can actually cook it. The badge answers the third, and
     * since 09-05 only when the answer is "not yet".
     *
     * The header's "Meal plan →" link went in the same batch — *"Leaning towards
     * removing the links to open relevant pages on the dashboard cards. Doesn't
     * look so clean and you can just click the main menu buttons. Remove them
     * all I reckon."* The empty state's "Plan a meal →" stays: an empty card
     * with no way out is a dead end, not a clean one.
     *
     * Extracted from `DashboardPage.vue` (FU-829). The row anatomy comes from
     * `css/dashboardCards.scss`, shared with Restock radar.
