"""FU-450 — deal-quality signal (upstream of the budget-defense swaps).

A pure function over a product's own offer history plus the household's
real paid-price history, producing a small ``DealQuality`` verdict. It
runs on any surface that already has a ``Product``:

* the Buy Verdict card (a `fake_markdown` demotes a `buy` → `wait`),
* the budget-defense swap ranker (fake markdowns are filtered out).

Design lock: `docs/04_proposals/PROPOSAL_BUDGET_DEFENSE_SWAPS.md` §4a.

**Explicitly NOT computed here** — the 0-100 numeric score, the percentile
UI surface, or a price-history chart. P8-05's Buy Verdict card is the
canonical "should I buy" surface; this signal feeds it, it doesn't
compete. The band (`poor/fair/good/great`) is an internal enum, never
rendered as a number.

Two layers, same file shape as `get_buy_verdict.py`:

* :func:`compute_deal_quality` — pure, no repo, driven by fixture lists
  in the unit tests.
* :func:`get_deal_quality` — the only part that touches the repo; loads a
  product's offers + the household's price observations and delegates.
