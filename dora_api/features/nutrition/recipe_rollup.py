"""Server-owned recipe nutrition rollup (FU-635 chunk 6).

Complex mode's one user-facing number: what a serving of this recipe holds,
summed from the foods its ingredients are linked to. Sibling of
`features/recipes/recipe_cost.py` — same shape (server owns the math, R-003;
the client renders it and never re-derives it), same honesty contract (a
partial total is always shown *with* its coverage, never as a clean figure).

The chain per ingredient is:

    RecipeIngredient.quantity + unit
      → StockItem.nutrition_food_id
        → NutritionFood (nutrients per 100g)
        + NutritionPortion (a household measure → its gram weight)
      → grams → nutrients

Every link can fail, and each failure is *named* rather than swallowed —
`uncounted` carries a count per reason so the UI can say "3 ingredients
aren't linked to a food" instead of an unexplained shortfall (P3 Honest).

**Grams are never guessed.** Mass units convert outright; volumes prefer the
food's own USDA portion row ("1 cup, chopped" → 125 g) and fall back to the
shared density table only when the food has no matching portion; counts
("2 bananas") need a portion row and are reported unconvertible without one.
Nothing here invents a weight (P12 No-invent) — an unconvertible ingredient
lands in the coverage line, where a partial total can't pass for a complete
one.

Optional ingredients sit outside both halves of the coverage ratio, matching
the cookability rule's treatment of them (R-003): they aren't part of the
recipe as written, so they neither add nutrients nor count as a gap.
