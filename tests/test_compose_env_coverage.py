"""Every env var the app reads must be accounted for in `compose.yml`.

Why this exists
---------------
`compose.yml`'s `environment:` block is an explicit allow-list. A var an
operator sets in `.env` that isn't named there never reaches the
container, and nothing complains — the app just behaves as though it were
unset. That's not hypothetical: `DORA_SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY` was missing
from the block for months (found 2026-08-17), so operators who set the
key correctly still got "Secret encryption isn't set up on this install",
and the whole encrypted-secrets surface was dead in the container. The
same audit found `DORA_SMTP_USER` in compose against `DORA_SMTP_USERNAME`
in the code — a silent one-word mismatch nothing would ever have caught.

`env_file:` now forwards the operator's whole `.env`, which fixes the
class of bug at runtime. This test guards the *documentation* half: it
fails when a new env var appears in the code and nobody decided whether
an operator is meant to set it. Every name must be either

  * present in the `environment:` block, or
  * listed in `INTENTIONALLY_OMITTED` below with a reason.

Adding a name to the omit-list is a fine outcome — the point is that the
decision is made once, in writing, rather than forgotten.

R-034-style structural pin: cheap, no runtime, and it re-checks by hand
in seconds something that takes half an hour to audit manually.
