"""P8-08 — The Dora Score.

A single, honest, explainable kitchen-health metric derived from five
signals — four over a rolling 30-day window, one over the week ahead (§P8-08 in
``docs/01_charter/DASHY_DORA_CHAMPION_PLAN.md``). Renders on the
dashboard as one composite number + a per-component breakdown + a
trend arrow (score vs. same score computed 7 days ago).

Design shape follows **R-027 + ADR-023** — a pure decision core with
no repository or DB access. The endpoint handler
(``features/dashboard/get_dora_score.py``) gathers the raw inputs and
delegates to :func:`compute_score` here. The same pattern is already
used for :mod:`buy_verdict` and :mod:`pantry_belief`; keeping the
score consistent with them means the unit tests never need a
database.

Charter guardrails baked in:

* **P3 Honest** — a component that has no data in the window is
  *excluded* from the mean (its weight goes to zero), not treated as
  zero. A user with no budget set doesn't drag the score down; a
  user with no waste tracking gets a 4-signal score, not a fake 5th.
* **P1 Effortless** — the score never nags; the frontend renders it
  as a positive-framed number ("you're at 72") with actions that
  *improve* the weak component, never "you failed at X".
* **R-003** — the score itself, the components, and their thresholds
  live server-side. The client renders whatever the server hands it.
* **R-010** — the component keys form a closed set (see
  :class:`DoraScoreComponentKey`). No stringly-typed enums.

    **Owner review, 2026-09-04.** He asked whether these were the right
    signals: *"Run-outs seems like an odd metric to base kitchen health on.
    Are we sure we have the best set of metrics for this score? We want it to
    be useful, not fluff/bloat."* Two were cut, two added, on one test — does
    the component measure a **kitchen outcome**, or does it measure **how
    diligently you use the app**?

      RUNOUTS (cut)    scored "you ran out of something that wasn't on a
                       list". Defensible in principle — a well-run kitchen
                       isn't surprised — but it only fires for households
                       that log consumption, so it graded logging, and it
                       punished a household for running a pantry deliberately
                       tight. FU-835 had already made the same case about its
                       neighbour.
      STOCKTAKE (cut)  scored "% of items you checked in the last 30 days",
                       which is entirely an activity metric: doing a stocktake
                       does not make the kitchen healthier, it makes Dora's
                       picture of it more accurate. That is FU-835 verbatim,
                       and cutting it resolves that follow-up.
