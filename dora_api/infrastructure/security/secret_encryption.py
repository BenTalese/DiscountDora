"""Data-at-rest encryption for every secret Dora stores in the DB.

Dora persists several secrets to the database — SMTP password, VAPID
private key, per-user paid-provider LLM API keys — and wraps them all
with a single Fernet key so a DB dump (or backup theft) doesn't leak
plaintext. That wrapping key is Dora's KEK (key-encryption-key); it
lives in the environment variable ``DORA_SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY`` and
must never be stored in the DB itself (a backup containing both the
ciphertext and the key that decrypts it defeats the point).

Operators set it once at boot (env file, systemd EnvironmentFile,
k8s secret, docker/compose env) — same shape as every other secret
the app needs (R-005 distribution posture: env-driven config). If the
variable is unset, :func:`encrypt` and :func:`decrypt` raise
:class:`EncryptionUnavailable` so callers can surface a friendly error
("secret encryption isn't configured for this install — set
DORA_SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY") instead of crashing. Ollama-only installs
that never save a paid-provider LLM key, an SMTP password, or Web-Push
keys can leave the variable unset; it's only required to *save* a
secret.

Why an env var, not a generated file:

- Matches every other secret the app needs (no special case).
- Postgres-friendly: the API server can be stateless (FU-045) and
  every replica reads the same key from its env.
- Operators get an explicit "I made a choice" signal — auto-generating
  a key file on first boot is convenient but hides the security model
  from the operator who'll eventually rotate the key.

Key generation (for ops docs):

    python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"

The returned string is a 32-byte url-safe-base64 value; that's what
goes into the env var verbatim.

History: this module lived at ``infrastructure/llm/key_encryption.py``
and its env var was named ``DORA_LLM_KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY`` because it
was introduced (FU-153) purely for LLM API keys. It was later reused
for SMTP + VAPID secrets without renaming, which misled operators who
didn't use LLMs into thinking the gating didn't apply to them. Renamed
2026-08-04.
