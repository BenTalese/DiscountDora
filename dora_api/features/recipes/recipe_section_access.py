"""C-4 Chunk 10 — read/write helpers for recipe sections.

A recipe owns 0..N `RecipeSection` rows (DEC-3 option A — named groups,
not sub-recipes). Sections aren't required: a recipe with zero sections
renders the same as it always did, with all ingredients/steps in the
implicit "main" group.

`replace_sections_for_recipe` is the single write path — wipes existing
sections and re-inserts from the request shape. Replace semantics match
how ingredients + steps are handled on the same endpoint. Because the FK
on RecipeIngredient.section_id / RecipeStep.section_id is ON DELETE SET
NULL, deleting a section keeps its rows (just unsectioned) — the
ingredients/steps replace path is the only thing that re-pins them.
