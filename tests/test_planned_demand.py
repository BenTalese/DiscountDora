"""Planned demand + the shared cooked-batch pool model (owner, 2026-09-03).

Two pure rules are pinned here — the allocation (`allocate_pool`) and the
grading (`urgency_for`, `build_reason`) — with no DB and no HTTP, the same way
`test_pantry_belief.py` pins the belief model. The repo walk on top of them is
a thin gather; the e2e suite covers it end to end.

The thing worth pinning hardest is that **coverage is all-or-nothing per
entry**: a 4-serving meal against a 3-serving pool still has to be cooked, so
its ingredients are still demand. Getting that wrong in the generous direction
would make the signal go quiet exactly when a batch has *nearly* run out,
which is the moment it is most worth saying something.
