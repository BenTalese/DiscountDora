"""GET /api/dashboard/use-it-up — what's about to go off, and what it cooks.

Owner feedback, 2026-09-04. The dashboard used to carry a "Needs your
attention" card and a "Dora suggests" card; between them and the alerts bell
and the Dora chat, four surfaces on one screen said the same thing. The owner
cut the two cards and asked the obvious next question: *"Surely… there's a LOT
of data in this app that is connected. Are there some insights into this that
could be useful to the end user?"*

This is one of the two answers. Expiry alone is not an insight — the bell
already states it, and stating it again is what made the attention card
redundant. The insight is the **join**: these three things go off this week,
*and here are the recipes that use them*, so the answer to "what do I cook
tonight" is the same as the answer to "what stops me throwing food away".

Nothing here is new domain logic. The expiry window is the household's own
`expiring_soon_window_days` setting read through the shared
`stock_attention` predicates (B1 — never a literal at the call site), and the
recipe→stock-item link is the same `_stock_item_id` FK `planned_demand` walks.
What is new is putting them together, which is precisely the work R-003 says
belongs on the server: the SPA cannot join expiry windows to ingredient links
without re-implementing both.

Not gated. Expiry needs no feature flag — every install tracks it — and the
card degrades to its empty state on a pantry with no expiry dates, which is
the honest answer rather than a hidden card.
