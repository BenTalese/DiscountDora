    <!-- Owner feedback 2026-09-05 — *"low and out to be circles with numbers
         left of the dropdown chevron, matching the all ingredients circle but
         with the low and out colours."* One badge, one shape: `sequence` null
         is the neutral count the "All ingredients" header carries, and a stock
         sequence tints it.

         Colour comes from `tintClassForSequence`, the same helper every other
         level pill in the app uses (R-003) — including its D-002 carve-out,
         which keeps the digits at `--text-primary` on a soft ground rather
         than at semantic ink that measured under 4.5:1 on the light themes.

         D-013 — a coloured circle is not a decodable signal on its own, so the
         badge carries an accessible name. It is deliberately NOT a tooltip:
         the tooltips these replaced were the ones the owner called useless. -->
