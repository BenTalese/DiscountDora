"""C-9.8 — Web Push sender (RFC 8030 + VAPID).

Wraps `pywebpush` so the rest of the codebase doesn't import a third-
party HTTP client. Mirrors `email_sender.py` shape: a single send_*
function, a dry-run mode when the install isn't configured, and the
config read in one place.

All three VAPID fields live on ``AppSetting`` (FU-333 Buckets B + C).
The private key is stored encrypted-at-rest with the Fernet helper
from FU-153 and decrypted on demand by the resolver. Admins edit
everything from Settings → Admin → System → Push.

When either half is missing the sender is in **dry-run** mode (logs
the push, returns success). This keeps an unconfigured install
bootable and lets developers test the surrounding plumbing without
generating keys.

Generate a key pair with `py-vapid`'s CLI (bundled with pywebpush):
    python -m py_vapid --gen --applicationServerKey
which prints the public key + writes `private_key.pem`.
