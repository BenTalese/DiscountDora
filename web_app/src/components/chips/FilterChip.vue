    <!-- DR-15 / D-010: a filter chip is one of the four high-frequency
         gestures. `dora-press` answers the touch itself; the bump fires when
         the chip's *state* flips, which is the bit that matters on a filter bar
         where several chips look similar and only the tone tells them apart.
         Both ride motion.scss tokens, so reduced-motion flattens them. -->
    <!-- B2a — a chip that can't be chosen stays in place, disabled, rather than
         vanishing: a row that reflows as options drop away costs the user their
         spatial memory of where a control was. `aria-pressed` is explicit
         because a q-chip is a div, so nothing announces its on/off state
         otherwise. -->

       to `--q-<colour>` — which for `secondary` is the *surface-grade*

       background, so the Essential / Open chips read as near-invisible
