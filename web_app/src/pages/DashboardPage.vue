        <!-- ───── Hero band ─────────────────────────────────────────────── -->
        <!-- Owner 2026-09-04 — "Dora says" was a separate dismissible band
             directly under this one, with its own 40px mascot. Two problems,
             both his: the band repeated the mascot standing right beside it
             ("Dora is literally right there. Seeing double feels a bit odd"),
             and it was a second card saying a softer version of what the hero
             already said. So the message moved *into* the hero and the band is
             gone — which also retires the per-day dismissal (`dashboard_welcome_
             dismissed_day` + `epochDay`): you can't dismiss half a header, and a
             message that rotates daily never needed a hide button.

             The factual line under the greeting went with it. It read
             "N items are out of stock", which the owner called out as pretty
             useless text to read — the alerts bell and the stock card both
             already answer that, better. Dora's message is the line now. -->

                 every width (the old flex hero wrapped the whole text column
                 under it on mobile), and the hint drops to its own row that
                 stops at the actions column, so it wraps before the Cards
                 button rather than running under it. That's a grid, not a
                 flex row: the two claims are "same row as the mascot" and
                 "spans only the first two columns", which flex can't state. -->

            <!-- Owner 2026-09-08 — *"Put the hint from the hero card into an
                 info box with an info icon at the front, like how you'd see it
                 in markdown/obsidian styling. Gives it some visual separation
                 and makes it look nice. It should still be within the hero
                 card."* It was a bare grey line under the greeting, which read
                 as a third sentence of the same paragraph rather than as a
                 different *kind* of thing — Dora's message of the day is voice,
                 the hint is a tip about the app.

                 An Obsidian-style callout is exactly the right borrow: a tinted
                 well, a leading rule in the accent tone, and an icon that
                 declares the genre before you read a word. The app already had
                 this shape once — `.dora-welcome`'s `border-left: 4px` band —
                 so this is the house pattern, not a new one.

                 Left inline rather than extracted to a component: this is its
                 only consumer. The moment a second callout appears anywhere
                 (Help, Settings, an empty state) it becomes a `BaseCallout` and
                 this markup moves into it (R-001 — two consumers is a pattern,
                 one is a card). -->

                 `upcoming_entries`, the grid from `/alerts/upcoming`'s 14 — so

                 a 7/14-day range toggle; 7 is the default because a week is the
                 planning unit.
                 D-012 also applies: a 7-day pip strip and a 14-day dot grid are
                 the same widget at two zoom levels, so they were never two
                 cards' worth of information.

                 hero line verbatim (§3.2), which is where that sentence lives.
                 Fed by `/alerts/upcoming`, the strip also gains expiry and
