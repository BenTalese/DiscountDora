        The Nutri-Score, drawn (owner ask 2026-08-27).

        One component for both surfaces — the recipe page's nutrition panel and
        the cookbook row's chip — because the two are the same claim at two
        sizes, and a second implementation would be the place the colours
        quietly diverge. Same reasoning as `RecipeHealthStars.vue`.

        **Dora draws its own badge; it does not reproduce the official
        Nutri-Score logo artwork.** The logo is a registered collective
        trademark of Santé publique France with its own graphic charter and a
        registration process aimed at food business operators putting products
        on the market. Dora is estimating a grade for someone's home cooking,
        which is a different act, and borrowing the official mark would dress an
        estimate up as a certified label. The five-letter scale is the published
        *scheme*; this is our rendering of it. Same call as the Health Star
        Rating, which draws generic star icons rather than the FSANZ mark.
