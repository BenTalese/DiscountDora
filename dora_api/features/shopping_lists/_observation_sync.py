"""Harvest and re-sync of ``StockItemPriceObservation`` rows from shopping
lines (FU-726).

Finishing a list turns every priced, item-anchored ticked line into one
observation, joined back by ``shopping_list_line_id``. Amending a *finished*
list (the receipt face) can change the very fields that observation was built
from — price, store, quantity — so the write has to happen in two places. It
therefore lives in one place here rather than being copy-pasted into
``manage_shopping_list_lines`` (R-003: one definition of a domain rule).

The two callers differ only in what they do about an observation that already
exists: ``/finish`` skips it (idempotent under a double-tapped button), amend
rewrites it (the whole point — a typo'd $110.00 must stop poisoning every
future estimate for that item).

    With ``overwrite_existing=True`` (receipt amend) the existing row is
    rewritten in place from the line's current price / store / quantity, and a
    line that has *lost* its price has its observation removed — leaving a
    stale number behind would be worse than having none, because observations
    feed the money ladder's historic rung.
