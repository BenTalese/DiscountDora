"""Corpus-driven baseline test for the paste-based recipe parser.

Iterates every ``.txt`` fixture in ``tests/fixtures/recipe_paste_corpus/``,
runs it through ``parse_recipe_from_text``, and asserts the minimum-shape
declared in ``_expectations.py``. The parser stub raises
``NotImplementedError`` until Chunk 2 lands; the test catches that and
skips the fixture cleanly so the suite stays green.

**Assertions are loose by design** — each field only fires when the
expectation is non-None, and numeric time fields carry a ±2 minute
tolerance. Pinning ``(qty, unit, text)`` tuples per row would make every
parser tweak break dozens of tests; loose fences catch regressions
without over-constraining. See ``_expectations.py`` for full field
semantics.
