        Compact cookbook row — one line per recipe, the Stock Overview
        shape (2026-08-17 feedback). Same data and the same actions as
        `RecipeCard`; only the layout differs, and every derived figure
        comes from the shared `useRecipeDisplay` so the two views can't
        drift (R-003).

        Chrome mirrors `StockItemRow`: bordered flat card, 8px radius,
        accent-tinted hover, no lift — and, from 2026-08-20, the same
        name type size and the same name-plus-second-line shape.

                 removed 2026-08-19 — owner: "remove the second info line under
                 the recipe name in compact view, looks too cluttered". It is
                 back on 2026-08-20, but as two facts rather than five:
                 "in desktop view put time and ingredient count right or
                 underneath of recipe name". Underneath, because the chip
                 cluster's width varies with how many chips a given recipe has,
                 so anything in it never lands twice in the same place (the
                 same reasoning that moved the expiring chip to the right edge)
                 — whereas a second line under the name starts at a fixed x.
                 Desktop only: on a phone these were already suppressed for
                 width, and that hasn't changed.
                 Icons, owner 2026-08-28: `timer` for a duration stays — a bare
                 "25m" is ambiguous. The ingredient count *lost* its icon and
                 gained the word instead ("6 ingredients"): the counter glyph
                 read as clutter at 14px and still needed explaining, whereas
                 the word explains itself and costs about the same width.
                 kcal joined this line rather than the chip cluster — it's a
                 plain fact about the dish, same species as the other two, and
                 the cluster is for opinions. -->
